      "summary": "The email discusses the need to enforce channel binding for LDAP on domain controllers. It identifies that many devices and software, such as HP and Xerox printers, Barracuda web content filter, and McAfee ePo, are using LDAP and may need to be updated to support the new binding or use LDAPS with a certificate. The email also mentions the default behavior of Win10 and Server 2012/2016 systems to use the new binding. It queries the need for explicit creation of the LdapEnforceChannelBindings registry entry after the patch with the LDAP changes is applied.",

The earlier changes have been to add the capabilities to address the security bypass and audit logging to show if organizations had systems that needed attention to prepare for the change. The October 10, 2023 update will remove the Admin override and default to full enforcement. For the Netlogon vulnerability, Microsoft is stepping up to full enforcement in July. The earlier changes have been to add the capabilities to address the security bypass and audit logging to show if organizations had systems that needed attention to prepare for the change. July’s update will remove the ability to override enforcement and allow compatibility mode for RPC Sealing. After deploying the July update, Netlogon will fully enforce RPC Sealing."
