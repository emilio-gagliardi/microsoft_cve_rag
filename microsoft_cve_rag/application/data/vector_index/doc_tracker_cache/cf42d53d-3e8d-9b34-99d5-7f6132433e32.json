Physical interaction may be brief or persistent. \nAttack Complexity \nThis metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker\u2019s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration. \nLow \nSpecialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success against the vulnerable component. \nPrivileges Required \n \nLow \nThe attacker is authorized with (i.e., requires) privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges may have the ability to cause an impact only to non-sensitive resources. \n.\n User Interaction \n \nNone \nThe vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user. \nScope \n \nUnchanged \nAn exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority. \nConfidentiality \n \nHigh \nThere is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact. \nIntegrity \n \nHigh \nThere is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component. \nAvailability \n \n.\n High \nThere is total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable). \n\ue8ec \n\ue974 \nTemporal score metrics \n(3) \nExploit Code Maturity \nThis metric measures the likelihood of the vulnerability being attacked, and is typically based on the current state of exploit techniques, exploit code availability, or active, 'in-the-wild' exploitation. \nUnproven \nNo exploit code is available, or an exploit is theoretical. \nRemediation Level \n \nOfficial Fix \nA complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. \nReport Confidence \n \nConfirmed \nDetailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this). \n.\n Source code is available to independently verify the assertions of the research, or the author or vendor of the affected code has confirmed the presence of the vulnerability. \nPlease see  \nCommon Vulnerability Scoring System \n for more information on the definition of these metrics. \nThe following table provides an  \nexploitability assessment \n for this vulnerability at the time of original publication. \nPublicly disclosed \nExploited \nExploitability assessment \nNo \nNo \nExploitation Less Likely \nWhat kind of security feature could be bypassed by successfully exploiting this vulnerability? \nA successful attacker could bypass the BitLocker Device Encryption feature on the system storage device. An attacker with physical access to the target could exploit this vulnerability to gain access to encrypted data. \nAre there additional steps that I need to take to be protected from this vulnerability? \nDepending on the version of Windows you are running, you may need to take additional steps to update Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE) to be protected from this vulnerability. \nFor the latest of Windows the process of updating WinRE is now fully automated.  The following versions of Windows require no additional steps as WinRE will be updated as a part of Latest Cumulative Update if you are getting updates from Windows Update and WSUS.: \nWindows 11 Version 23H2 for x64-based Systems \nWindows 11 Version 23H2 for ARM64-based Systems \nWindows 11 Version 22H2 for x64-based Systems \nWindows 11 Version 22H2 for ARM64-based Systems \nFor the following Windows versions an automated solution is available.

This vulnerability allows an attacker with physical access to bypass the BitLocker Device Encryption feature on the system storage device, potentially gaining access to encrypted data. The attack vector is physical, with low attack complexity and low privileges required. Microsoft has provided a solution by releasing security updates for various Windows versions, including Windows 10, Windows 11, and Windows Server 2022, to address this vulnerability. Depending on the Windows version, system administrators may need to take additional steps to update Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE) to be protected from this vulnerability. For some versions, the process of updating WinRE is fully automated, while for others, an automated solution is available. Microsoft has also developed a sample script to automate updating WinRE from the running Windows OS. It's important to note that a vulnerable version of WinRE WIM file cannot be used to exploit this vulnerability, and if TPM+PIN BitLocker protectors are being used, the attacker needs to know the TPM PIN to exploit the vulnerability. System administrators are advised to apply the provided security updates and follow the recommended steps to ensure protection from this vulnerability.", "impact_type": null, "severity_type": "important", "adp_attack_complexity": null, "adp_attack_vector": null, "adp_availability": null, "adp_base_score": null, "adp_base_score_num": null, "adp_base_score_rating": null, "adp_confidentiality": null, "adp_exploitability_score": null, "adp_impact_score": null, "adp_integrity": null, "adp_privileges_required": null, "adp_scope": null, "adp_user_interaction": null, "adp_vector": null, "cna_attack_complexity": "low", "cna_attack_vector": "physical", "cna_availability": "high", "cna_base_score": null, "cna_base_score_num": 6.6, "cna_base_score_rating": "medium", "cna_confidentiality": "high", "cna_exploitability_score": 0.7, "cna_impact_score": 5.9, "cna_integrity": "high", "cna_privileges_required": "low", "cna_scope": "unchanged", "cna_user_interaction": null, "cna_vector": "av:p/ac:l/pr:l/ui:n/s:u/c:h/i:h/a:h", "cve_category": "feature_bypass", "cwe_id": "CWE-20", "cwe_name": "Improper Input Validation", "cwe_source": "Microsoft Corporation", "cwe_url": "http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html", "etl_processing_status": {"document_processed": true, "nvd_extracted": true, "entities_extracted": true, "graph_prepared": true, "vector_prepared": true, "last_processed_at": "2025-01-02T12:19:39.876204", "processing_version": "1.0"}, "nist_attack_complexity": null, "nist_attack_vector": null, "nist_availability": null, "nist_base_score": null, "nist_base_score_num": null, "nist_base_score_rating": null, "nist_confidentiality": null, "nist_exploitability_score": null, "nist_impact_score": null, "nist_integrity": null, "nist_privileges_required": null, "nist_scope": null, "nist_user_interaction": null, "nist_vector": null, "nvd_description": "bitlocker security feature bypass vulnerability", "nvd_published_date": "2024-01-09T00:00:00", "id_": null, "kb_ids": ["KB-5034134", "KB-5034123", "KB-5034122", "KB-5034121"], "node_label": "MSRCPost"}, "added_at": "2025-01-01T23:19:38.450711", "last_updated": "2025-01-02T18:44:35.511454"}
