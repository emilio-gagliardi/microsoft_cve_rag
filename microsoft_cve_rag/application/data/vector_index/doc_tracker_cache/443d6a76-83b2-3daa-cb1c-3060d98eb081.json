Do not open attachments or\nclick on links from unknown senders or unexpected emails. \nI have my WSUS test environment set to auto-sync and auto-approve patches at\n1:10 pm EST so it gets the patches as soon as Microsoft releases them\non Patch Tuesday (usually at 10 am PST) but yesterday I got nothing at that\ntime. \nWhen I manually sync\u2019d this morning it was unusually small bringing in only 43\nupdates for a total of 11.1 GB.\nUsually it is much higher than that with patch metadata and anywhere from 15 to\n21 GB of binary data. \nIs everyone else seeing the same thing and any speculation why the release was\nlater than usual and the size was so small this time? \nJustin Blocksom\u00a0| Senior System Administrator |\u00a0WSUS Enterprise Architect\njustin.blocksom@uhsinc.com\nUniversal Health Services, Inc.| UHS of Delaware, Inc.| 367 South Gulph Road,\nKing of Prussia, PA 19406 | www.uhsinc.com\n[https://can01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.uhsinc.com%2F&data=05%7C02%7Cemail_ingestion%40bighatgroup.com%7C74a7dabb379c4c0f9c9508dbfbedd64d%7C5a01497e1bcb4711b6e6d24f4ab00393%7C0%7C0%7C638380771148338304%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=ZWRK4scHxoI2cM76WuHhsbkkRyX5Wtn9tjMBbruaaP0%3D&reserved=0] \nUHS of Delaware, Inc.
