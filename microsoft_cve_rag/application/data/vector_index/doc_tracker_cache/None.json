Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers). \nAttack Complexity \nThis metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker\u2019s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration. \nLow \nSpecialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success against the vulnerable component. \nPrivileges Required \n \nNone \nThe attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack. \n.\n User Interaction \n \nRequired \nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited. \nScope \n \nUnchanged \nAn exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority. \nConfidentiality \n \nHigh \nThere is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact. \nIntegrity \n \nNone \nThere is no loss of integrity within the impacted component. \nAvailability \n \nNone \nThere is no impact to availability within the impacted component. \n.\n \ue8ec \n\ue974 \nTemporal score metrics \n(3) \nExploit Code Maturity \nThis metric measures the likelihood of the vulnerability being attacked, and is typically based on the current state of exploit techniques, exploit code availability, or active, 'in-the-wild' exploitation. \nUnproven \nNo exploit code is available, or an exploit is theoretical. \nRemediation Level \n \nOfficial Fix \nA complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. \nReport Confidence \n \nConfirmed \nDetailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this). Source code is available to independently verify the assertions of the research, or the author or vendor of the affected code has confirmed the presence of the vulnerability. \nPlease see  \nCommon Vulnerability Scoring System \n for more information on the definition of these metrics. \nThe following table provides an  \nexploitability assessment \n for this vulnerability at the time of original publication. \nPublicly disclosed \nExploited \nExploitability assessment \nNo \nNo \nExploitation Less Likely \nMitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. \n.\n The following mitigations might apply in your situation: \nSystems that have disabled NTLM are not affected. \nApply the existing group policy to block NTLM hash. With this policy enabled, this issue for a remote SMB location client or server can be mitigated. To enable the policy: Select  \nComputer Configuration \n >   \nWindows Settings \n > ** Security Settings** >  \nLocal Policies \n >  \nSecurity Options \n. On the right pane, double-click the Network security: Restrict NTLM: Outgoing NTLM traffic to remote servers policy per the options listed below in the Network security:  \nRestrict NTLM: Outgoing NTLM traffic to remote servers \n documentation. \nReferences \n: \nFor customers running Windows Server 2008 or 2008 R2:  \nIntroducing the Restriction of NTLM Authentication \nFor customers running Windows 7 or 2008 R2:  \nNTLM Blocking and You \nFor customers running Windows 10 or 11: Network security: Restrict NTLM: Outgoing NTLM traffic to remote servers  \nNetwork security: Restrict NTLM: Add remote server exceptions for NTLM authentication \nAccording to the CVSS metric, user interaction is required (UI:R). What interaction would the user have to do? \nAn attacker would have to convince the user to load a malicious file onto a vulnerable system, typically by way of an enticement in an Email or Instant Messenger message, and then convince the user to manipulate the specially crafted file, but not necessarily click or open the malicious file. \nTomer Peled \n with  \nAkamai \nMicrosoft recognizes the efforts of those in the security community who help us protect customers through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

CVE-2024-21320, affects various Windows versions, including Windows Server and Windows 10/11. The vulnerability allows an attacker to convince a user to load a malicious file onto a vulnerable system, leading to spoofing. The attack vector is through user interaction, requiring the user to manipulate a specially crafted file. Microsoft has provided a solution by releasing security updates for the affected Windows versions, including Monthly Rollup and Security Update patches. The exploit code maturity is unproven, and the remediation level indicates that an official fix is available. Mitigations include applying group policies to block NTLM hash and disabling NTLM. System administrators are advised to apply the available security updates to mitigate the risk of exploitation.
