Learn why this is important\nat https://aka.ms/LearnAboutSenderIdentification ] This is going to cause a\nchange in our procedures. We have floor machines whose names are known, and we\nreplace them with new machines and name them the same as the incumbent. Now the\nhelpdesk are going to have to decommission the old machine, delete the account\nin AD, wait for the deletion to replicate, put the new machine in place, rename\nit, join it to the domain and put it in the proper OU. Some of this can be done\nwith a single PowerShell command, but it's going to cause problems. Worse, If\nI'm reading the article incorrectly (and I might be), I can't run a PowerShell\nscript to take ownership of the machine accounts in AD for the DAs. That seems\nless than ideal. This is the section of the article to which I'm referring,\nunder \"Nonsolutions\" \"Do not manually edit the security descriptor on computer\naccounts in an attempt to redefine the ownership of such accounts, unless the\nprevious owner account has been deleted. While editing the owner will enable the\nnew checks to succeed, the computer account might retain the same potentially\nrisky, unwanted permissions for the original owner unless explicitly reviewed\nand removed.\" Kurt On Tue, Feb 13, 2024 at 5:38\u202fPM 'Susan Bradley' via\nPatchManagement wrote:\nLink: None \n", "evaluated_keywords": "['single powershell command', 'previous owner account', 'computer account might retain', 'unwanted permission']", "evaluated_noun_chunks": "['change in our procedures', 'new machines', 'single PowerShell command', 'machine accounts in AD']", "post_type": "Problem statement", "unique_tokens": 119, "product_build_ids": [], "thread_id": "kb5020276netjoin_domain_join_hardening_changes", "previous_id": "5cc81ed4-0441-8e70-4990-c55e42f6c525", "next_id": "1dd31186-c905-39df-2f09-6d90389f1498", "etl_processing_status": {"document_processed": true, "entities_extracted": true, "graph_prepared": false, "vector_prepared": true, "last_processed_at": "2025-01-07T00:05:44.721193", "processing_version": "1.0"}, "doc_id": "d5756ada-6aad-863b-32bd-394b8532045b", "noun_chunks": "['change in our procedures', 'new machines', 'single PowerShell command', 'machine accounts in AD']", "keywords": "['single powershell command', 'previous owner account', 'computer account might retain', 'unwanted permission']", "node_label": "PatchManagementPost", "kb_ids": [], "cve_ids": "", "embedding": null, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["id", "added_to_vector_store", "added_to_summary_index", "added_to_graph_store", "cve_fixes", "cve_mentions", "email_text_original", "unique_tokens", "tags"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["id", "added_to_vector_store", "added_to_summary_index", "added_to_graph_store", "cve_fixes", "cve_mentions", "email_text_original", "unique_tokens", "tags"], "build_numbers": [], "product_mentions": [], "is_processed": false, "reliability": "", "readability": "", "extracted_symptoms": ["ce4642e5-222d-4eaf-8341-0b921a4ebdc8"], "extracted_causes": [], "extracted_fixes": [], "extracted_tools": [], "added_at": "2025-01-07T00:39:27.042391", "last_updated": "2025-01-07T00:39:27.042391"}
