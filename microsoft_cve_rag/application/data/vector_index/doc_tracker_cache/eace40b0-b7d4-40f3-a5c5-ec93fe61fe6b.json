{"tool_label": "AutomatedSchedulerSettingsConfigurationTool", "description": "A tool that supports the automated configuration of scheduler settings related to core allocations in Linux kernels. This tool addresses the longstanding limitation of hardcoding the maximum number of cores, allowing system administrators to define and adapt the core scaling based on their specific workload needs. It facilitates dynamic resource management by enabling adjustments to be made without requiring manual edits to kernel configurations. The tool aims to leverage more than 8 cores, overcoming constraints present in legacy systems.
