For more information, see the  \nSecurity Update Guide \n. \nStable channel security updates are listed  \nhere \n. \nAnnouncement: Microsoft Edge for Business is available for unmanaged Windows devices \nMicrosoft Edge for Business is a dedicated Microsoft Edge experience built for work that enables admins in organizations to give their users a productive and secure work browser. This dedicated work experience is now available for unmanaged Windows devices using Microsoft Intune Mobile Application Management (MAM). This release includes the supporting changes for Microsoft Edge. When the required Intune update is released, more information will be available on how to test and deploy this feature with your users. \nNote: \nSupport is available for Windows 11, build 10.0.22621 (22H2) or later. \nRequires Microsoft Intune 2309 or higher \nApp Protection Conditional Access is in Public Preview. \nIf you have a Conditional Access (CA) policy on your tenant that targets \"All cloud apps\" that covers \"Mobile apps and desktop clients\" and requires a compliant device, app protection policies or has a \"Block\" grant control, your end users will not be able to MAM enroll. A change to support this is targeted for Microsoft Edge v118. \nIf you want to continue testing/evaluating APP CA, you can choose to exclude the \"Edge Auth\" application from your cloud app targeting. Some Microsoft Edge features might not function properly until CA is satisfied, but MAM enrollment will be able to complete. \nAnnouncement: Deprecating the unload event \nThe Google Chrome team plans to deprecate the unload event starting in Chrome version 118. The deprecation will occur by gradually changing the default so unload handlers stop firing on pages unless a page explicitly opts in to re-enable them. For more information, see  \nDeprecating the unload event - Chrome Developers \n, and  \nGoogle Groups - Conversations \n. \nWhile we haven't yet finalized the deprecation schedule, we anticipate that Microsoft Edge will follow Chrome's schedule with a possible delay of a release or two. If you're interested in testing with Microsoft Edge starting in version 118, the  \nForcePermissionPolicyUnloadDefaultEnabled \n policy will be available or you can use the instructions documented at  \nDisable unload handlers by default and add Permissions-Policy to opt-in to enabling them \n. \nWebView2 will support both the permissions policy and the enterprise policy but won't be impacted by the gradual rollout in Microsoft Edge. We expect WebView2 will switch defaults when the roll out reaches 100% of page loads. \nFeature updates \nMicrosoft Edge for Business Banner. \n  Administrators can control the availability of the in-product Microsoft Edge for Business banner using the  \nPromotionalTabsEnabled \n policy. \nMicrosoft Edge Sync Favorites Recovery. \n The Microsoft Edge Sync Favorites Recovery feature lets sync users restore any favorites that they lost or deleted within the last 14 days. Users can access this feature from either the Microsoft Edge favorites hub or the  \nedge://favorites \n page. For more information, see  \nRecover lost or deleted favorites in Microsoft Edge - Microsoft Support \nAutofill Autocomplete. \n This feature helps you fill form fields faster on the web. When you start typing in a form field, Microsoft Edge suggests possible in-line completions when there's an exact match with your saved data in the browser. For example, if you type the first few characters of your address, autocomplete will suggest the rest of address - you can choose the autocomplete suggestion or continue typing as usual. Autofill options can be found in Settings ( \nedge://settings/personalinfo \n). \nDeprecation of Web Select. \n To improve end user experience, this feature is being deprecated and will no longer be an option under Web Capture or via keyboard shortcut. \nDeprecation of features. \n To improve end user experience and simplify the  \nMore tools \n menu, the following features are being deprecated: Math Solver, Picture Dictionary, Citations, Grammar Tools, and Kids Mode. \nPolicy updates \nNew policies \nAllowSystemNotifications \n - Allows system notifications \nEdgeWalletEtreeEnabled \n - Edge Wallet E-Tree Enabled \nGamerModeEnabled \n - Enable Gamer Mode \nSearchbarAllowed \n - Enable the Search bar \nSearchbarIsEnabledOnStartup \n - Allow the Search bar at Windows startup \nShowHistoryThumbnails \n - Show thumbnail images for browsing history \nUploadFromPhoneEnabled \n - Enable upload files from phone in Microsoft Edge desktop \nInternetExplorerIntegrationZoneIdentifierMhtFileAllowed \n - Automatically open downloaded MHT or MHTML files from the web in Internet Explorer mode \nPasswordDeleteOnBrowserCloseEnabled \n - Save passwords when Microsoft Edge closes \nSplitScreenEnabled \n - Enable split screen feature in Microsoft Edge \nDeprecated policies \nWebWidgetAllowed \n - Enable the Search bar \nWebWidgetIsEnabledOnStartup \n - Allow the Search bar at Windows startup \nObsoleted policy \nWebSelectEnabled \n - Web Select Enabled \n", "title": "Version: 117.0.2045.31: September 15, 2023", "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["node_id", "product_build_id", "cve_ids", "build_number", "node_label", "product_build_ids"], "summary": null, "metadata": {"cve_ids": ["CVE-2023-36727", "CVE-2023-4909", "CVE-2023-4908", "CVE-2023-4907", "CVE-2023-4906", "CVE-2023-4905", "CVE-2023-4904", "CVE-2023-4903", "CVE-2023-4902", "CVE-2023-4901", "CVE-2023-4900", "CVE-2023-36562", "CVE-2023-36735"], "embedding": null, "product_build_ids": null, "node_label": "KBArticle"}, "added_at": "2024-11-27T19:49:12.782351", "last_updated": "2024-11-28T12:08:36.399128"}
