Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers). \nAttack Complexity \nThis metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker\u2019s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration. \nHigh \nA successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. \n.\n For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack). \nPrivileges Required \n \nHigh \nThe attacker is authorized with (i.e., requires) privileges that provide significant (e.g., administrative) control over the vulnerable component that could affect component-wide settings and files. \nUser Interaction \n \nNone \nThe vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user. \nScope \n \nChanged \nAn exploited vulnerability can affect resources beyond the security scope managed by the security authority of the vulnerable component. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are different and managed by different security authorities. \nConfidentiality \n \nHigh \nThere is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact. \nIntegrity \n \nHigh \nThere is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. \n.\n Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component. \nAvailability \n \nHigh \nThere is total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable). \n\ue8ec \n\ue974 \nTemporal score metrics \n(3) \nExploit Code Maturity \nThis metric measures the likelihood of the vulnerability being attacked, and is typically based on the current state of exploit techniques, exploit code availability, or active, 'in-the-wild' exploitation. \nUnproven \nNo exploit code is available, or an exploit is theoretical. \nRemediation Level \n \nOfficial Fix \nA complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. \nReport Confidence \nThis metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. \n.\n The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers. \nConfirmed \nDetailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this). Source code is available to independently verify the assertions of the research, or the author or vendor of the affected code has confirmed the presence of the vulnerability. \nPlease see  \nCommon Vulnerability Scoring System \n for more information on the definition of these metrics. \nThe following table provides an  \nexploitability assessment \n for this vulnerability at the time of original publication. \nPublicly disclosed \nExploited \nExploitability assessment \nNo \nNo \nExploitation Less Likely \nAccording to the CVSS metric, privileges required is high (PR:H). What does that mean for this vulnerability? \nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability requires the attacker or targeted user to have both domain user and delegate management permissions on a non-default DFS namespace. \nHow could an attacker exploit this vulnerability? \nAn attacker could exploit a DFS namespace (non-default) out-of-bound write vulnerability that results in heap corruption, which could then be used to perform arbitrary code execution on the server's dfssvc.exe process which runs as SYSTEM user. \nAccording to the CVSS metric, attack complexity is high (AC:H). What does that mean for this vulnerability? \nIn a real-world attack scenario, a domain admin would have to configure their DFS namespace in such a way to add a low privileged domain user to the delegate management permission on a certain DFS namespace. \nIn essence, a successful exploitation of this vulnerability would require a non-default and unlikely configuration. \nAccording to the CVSS metric, a successful exploitation could lead to a scope change (S:C). What does this mean for this vulnerability? \nAn exploited vulnerability can affect resources beyond the security scope managed by the security authority of the vulnerable component. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are different and managed by different security authorities. \n.\n k0shl \n with  \nKunlun Lab \nMicrosoft recognizes the efforts of those in the security community who help us protect customers through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

"summary": "Windows Distributed File System (DFS) is affected by a Remote Code Execution vulnerability, identified as CVE-2023-36425, with a CVSS score of 8.0/7.0. The vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server's dfssvc.exe process, running as SYSTEM user, by exploiting a non-default DFS namespace out-of-bound write vulnerability that results in heap corruption. Successful exploitation requires the attacker or targeted user to have both domain user and delegate management permissions on the affected DFS namespace. The attack complexity is high, requiring a non-default and unlikely configuration by a domain admin. This vulnerability has a high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Microsoft has provided a security update for various Windows versions, including Windows Server and Windows 10, addressing this critical issue. System administrators are advised to apply the provided security updates to mitigate the risk of exploitation and ensure the security of their systems.", "impact_type": null, "severity_type": "NST", "etl_processing_status": {"document_processed": true, "nvd_extracted": true, "entities_extracted": false, "graph_prepared": false, "vector_prepared": false, "last_processed_at": "2024-12-30T11:58:32.517164", "processing_version": "1.0"}, "kb_ids": ["KB-5032199", "KB-5032192", "KB-5032190", "KB-5032189"], "cve_category": "NC", "nvd_published_date": "2023-11-14T00:00:00", "cna_base_score_num": 8.0, "cna_attack_complexity": "high", "adp_user_interaction": "None", "cna_user_interaction": "none", "cna_exploitability_score": 1.3, "adp_base_score": null, "nist_confidentiality": "None", "cwe_name": "Heap-based Buffer Overflow", "adp_base_score_num": null, "cna_base_score": null, "cwe_id": "CWE-122", "adp_integrity": "None", "nist_attack_vector": "None", "cna_integrity": "high", "cna_base_score_rating": "high", "nist_base_score_rating": "None", "nist_vector": null, "nvd_description": "windows distributed file system (dfs) remote code execution vulnerability", "adp_base_score_rating": "None", "cna_availability": "high", "cna_scope": "changed", "adp_impact_score": null, "cna_privileges_required": "high", "adp_confidentiality": "None", "nist_user_interaction": "None", "nist_scope": "None", "nist_exploitability_score": null, "cna_vector": "av:n/ac:h/pr:h/ui:n/s:c/c:h/i:h/a:h", "cwe_url": "http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/122.html", "adp_attack_vector": "None", "adp_availability": "None", "nist_privileges_required": "None", "adp_attack_complexity": "None", "nist_impact_score": null, "nist_base_score": null, "cwe_source": "Microsoft Corporation", "cna_attack_vector": "network", "cna_confidentiality": "high", "adp_privileges_required": "None", "adp_scope": "None", "nist_availability": "None", "nist_integrity": "None", "nist_base_score_num": null, "nist_attack_complexity": "None", "adp_vector": null, "adp_exploitability_score": null, "cna_impact_score": 6.0, "node_label": "MSRCPost"}, "added_at": "2024-12-30T12:17:36.290663", "last_updated": "2024-12-30T12:19:24.630312"}
