Servicing stack updates (SSU) ensure that you have a robust and reliable servicing stack so that your devices can receive and install Microsoft updates. \nKnown issues in this update \nSymptom \nWorkaround \nAfter installing this security update, you might face issues with booting Linux if you have enabled the dual-boot setup for Windows and Linux in your device. Resulting from this issue, your device might fail to boot Linux and show the error message \u201cVerifying shim SBAT data failed: Security Policy Violation. Something has gone seriously wrong: SBAT self-check failed: Security Policy Violation.\u201d \nThe August 2024 Windows security update applies a Secure Boot Advanced Targeting (SBAT) setting to devices that run Windows to block old, vulnerable boot managers. This SBAT update will not be applied to devices where dual booting is detected. On some devices, the dual-boot detection did not detect some customized methods of dual-booting and applied the SBAT value when it should not have been applied. \nPlease refer to the workaround mentioned in Windows release health site for this issue. \nHow to get this update \nBefore you install this update \nMicrosoft now combines the latest servicing stack update (SSU) for your operating system with the latest cumulative update (LCU).\u00a0For general information about SSUs,\u00a0see  \nServicing stack updates \n\u00a0and\u00a0 \nServicing Stack Updates (SSU): Frequently Asked Questions \n. \nPrerequisite: \nBased on your installation scenario, choose one of the following: \nFor offline OS image servicing: \nIf your image does not have the\u00a0March 22, 2022 ( \nKB5011543 \n) or later LCU, you  \nmust  \ninstall the special standalone May 10, 2022 SSU ( \nKB5014032 \n) before installing this update. \nFor Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) deployment or when installing the standalone package from Microsoft Update Catalog: \nIf your devices do not have the May 11, 2021\u00a0( \nKB5003173 \n)\u00a0or later LCU, you  \nmust  \ninstall the special standalone August 10, 2021 SSU ( \nKB5005260 \n) before installing this update. \nInstall this update \nTo install this update, use one of the following Windows and Microsoft release channels. \nWindows Update \nBusiness \nCatalog \nServer Update Services \nAvailable \nNext Step \nYes \nNone. This update will be downloaded and installed automatically from Windows Update and Microsoft Update. \nAvailable \nNext Step \nYes \nNone.

You can find the package name\u00a0by using this command:  \nDISM /online /get-packages \n. \nRunning  \nWindows Update Standalone Installer \n ( \nwusa.exe \n) with the  \n/uninstall  \nswitch on the combined package will not work because the combined package contains the SSU. You cannot remove the SSU from the system after installation. \nFile information \nFor a list of the files that are provided in this update, download the\u00a0 \nfile information for cumulative update 5044273 \n. \nFor a list of the files that are provided in the servicing stack update, download the\u00a0 \nfile information for the SSU (KB5043130) - versions 19044.4950 and 19045.4950 \n. \nSUBSCRIBE RSS FEEDS \n", "published": "2024-10-08T00:00:00", "product_build_id": "3b456540-426b-c1ca-351a-6f1427ccaaed", "build_number": [10, 0, 19045, 5011], "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["product_build_ids", "node_label", "node_id", "product_build_id", "cve_ids", "build_number"], "article_url": "https://support.microsoft.com/help/5044273", "summary": "KB5044273 is a security update released on October 8, 2024, which targets Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021, Windows 10 IoT Enterprise LTSC 2021, and Windows 10 version 22H2 (OS Builds 19044.5011 and 19045.5011).
