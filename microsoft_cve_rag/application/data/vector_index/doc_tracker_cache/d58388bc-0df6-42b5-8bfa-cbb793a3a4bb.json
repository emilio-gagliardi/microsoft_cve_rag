{"symptom_label": "VirtualMachinesFailedToStartAfterPatch", "description": "After patching one host node in a Server 2022 Hyper-V and StarWind two-node cluster, virtual machines failed to start. The issue was identified when a replicated Cluster Shared Volume (CSV) was incorrectly reported as Master Boot Record (MBR) instead of GUID Partition Table (GPT) in Disk Management. This situation necessitated re-creating the corrupt CSV and restoring the lost virtual machine from backup, highlighting the risk of patching similar clusters without proper precautions, especially in production environments.", "source_id": "93f905c3-1aa9-080b-d543-460dcf6b3a99", "source_type": "PatchManagementPost", "tags": ["Hyper-V", "StarWind", "ClusterManagement"], "node_id": "d58388bc-0df6-42b5-8bfa-cbb793a3a4bb", "metadata": {"node_label": "Symptom", "reliability": 0.85, "severity_type": "important", "entity_type": "Symptom"}, "added_at": "2024-12-20T13:03:35.316398", "last_updated": "2024-12-20T13:03:35.316398"}
