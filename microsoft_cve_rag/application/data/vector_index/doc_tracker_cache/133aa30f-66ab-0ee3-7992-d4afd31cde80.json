Today is my last work day as network\nmanager, IT coordinator and general tech person at Virginia Highlands Community\nCollege where I have spent the past 40 years. I will officially retire on\nDecember 31 and am looking forward to other adventures. I've been a member of\nthe ntsysadmin list longer that I can think about (my oldest saved email, a\njoke, from that list is dated 2006) and the patch management list for several\nyears also. I wanted to take a second to express a heart felt THANK YOU to all\nthat participate in both of these most helpful lists. You have been an\ninvaluable part of making my career in IT a success. Thank you for sharing your\nknowledge, advice and most of all, your time. I can't imagine being able to do\nhalf of what I did without this great resource. Merry Christmas to those of you\nthat choose to celebrate this and best wishes to everyone. May patch Tuesdays be\ncalm and all your systems run smoothly over the coming years. Take care and so\nlong. Glen. --\nLink: None \n", "evaluated_keywords": "['merry christmas', 'happy retirement']", "evaluated_noun_chunks": "['Happy Retirement', 'Merry Christmas']", "post_type": "Conversational", "unique_tokens": 11, "product_build_ids": [], "cve_ids": null, "etl_processing_status": {"document_processed": true, "entities_extracted": true, "graph_prepared": true, "vector_prepared": true, "last_processed_at": "2025-01-01T20:22:57.604729", "processing_version": "1.0"}, "is_processed": true, "next_id": "c3865c4a-4818-e9e6-9dde-65e29cd7641f", "previous_id": "133aa30f-66ab-0ee3-7992-d4afd31cde80", "product_mentions": [], "thread_id": "thanks_merry_christmas_llong", "noun_chunks": "['Happy Retirement', 'Merry Christmas']", "keywords": "['merry christmas', 'happy retirement']", "node_label": "PatchManagementPost", "kb_ids": [], "build_numbers": []}, "added_at": "2025-01-01T18:03:51.831225", "last_updated": "2025-01-01T20:31:22.541334"}
