{"tool_label": "HpSmartAppIdentification", "description": "The 'HP Smart' app is an application that assists users in managing their HP printers. In the context described, it is installed automatically when the operating system incorrectly identifies a printer as an HP model. This can lead to unnecessary installations and potential confusion for users who do not own an HP printer. The app provides features for scanning, printing, and managing printer settings, which may not be applicable to all users experiencing the identification issue. Understanding this behavior can help system administrators address user confusion and manage unexpected app installs effectively.", "source_id": "41b6bcd8-59e2-cdb8-eb4a-df11ea280793", "source_type": "PatchManagementPost", "tool_url": "https://www.hp.com/us-en/support/hp-smart.html", "tags": ["HP", "printer management", "automated installation"], "node_id": "37d27c22-1b3c-436a-bf1e-735bbe4871c1", "metadata": {"source_url": "//groups.google.com/d/msgid/patchmanagement/SN6PR08MB55179ACA61EC86567C9D36DBB785A%40SN6PR08MB5517.namprd08.prod.outlook.com", "node_label": "Tool", "reliability": 0.8, "severity_type": "moderate", "entity_type": "Tool"}, "added_at": "2024-12-31T14:32:24.587818", "last_updated": "2024-12-31T14:32:24.587818"}
