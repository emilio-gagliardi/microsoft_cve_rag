{"symptom_label": "GuestOsFailsToStartAfterOctoberCUInstall", "description": "After installing the October cumulative update (KB5031362) on ESXi 6.5 with clustered Windows Server 2016 guest operating systems, the guest OS may fail to start. Users report that the issue can sometimes be resolved by deleting two specific files, but upon rebooting, the same startup failure occurs, requiring the files to be deleted again. The lack of consistent information regarding impacted operating systems and ESXi versions contributes to uncertainty about the persistence of this problem.", "source_id": "7f58f800-9b60-c769-ffa9-007b7083ca27", "source_type": "PatchManagementPost", "tags": ["ESXi", "GuestOS", "CumulativeUpdate"], "node_id": "4ad345bf-c478-4d7f-bf49-01efd5ab6631", "metadata": {"node_label": "Symptom", "reliability": 0.85, "severity_type": "important", "entity_type": "Symptom"}, "added_at": "2024-12-20T13:03:36.541245", "last_updated": "2024-12-20T13:03:36.541245"}
