{"tool_label": "ReagentcDiskParser", "description": "**Tool Overview**:\n\nThe Reagentc Disk Parser script is designed to determine the correct primary disk and partition for Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE) setups, especially in complex multi-disk configurations.\n\n**Functionality**:\nThis script first identifies which disk is designated for OS and WinRE by parsing the output of `reagentc.exe /info`. It extracts the disk number and partition information, adjusting for systems where the primary disk may not be as expected (typically assumed to be disk 0).\n\n**Usage**:\n1. Execute the `reagentc.exe /info` command to retrieve current WinRE settings.\n2. Use regex to parse the output and find the WinRE location and corresponding disk/partition.\n3. Check if the identified WinRE partition is sufficiently sized (minimum 1GB) and adjust as necessary.\n4. Replace static disk references in the script with the dynamically retrieved values for flexibility across different hardware configurations.\n\nThis script enhances reliability in ensuring WinRE is set up correctly across a range of devices with varied disk configurations.", "source_id": "34392dc6-6987-ab7d-38e4-e1c6893c036a", "source_type": "PatchManagementPost", "tool_url": "", "tags": ["PowerShell", "disk management", "WinRE", "recovery", "LLM Synthesized"], "node_id": "7cca5751-41b3-448b-bcb7-3cd2328f943f", "metadata": {"source_url": "//groups.google.com/d/msgid/patchmanagement/SA0PR09MB7116CACF268980E52ACE8ED9A5AEA%40SA0PR09MB7116.namprd09.prod.outlook.com", "node_label": "Tool", "reliability": 0.7, "severity_type": "important", "entity_type": "Tool"}, "added_at": "2025-01-03T16:02:06.725920", "last_updated": "2025-01-03T16:02:06.725920"}
