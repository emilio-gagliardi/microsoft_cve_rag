{"symptom_label": "Office365AppsNotReceivingSecurityUpdates", "description": "This symptom indicates that Office 365 applications are not receiving expected security updates for the current month, creating potential gaps in protection. The only change noted was the disabling of FBX files by default, yet the absence of security fixes raises concerns regarding the safeguarding of the applications. Given that devices are configured for monthly enterprise updates, any delays in receiving these updates could leave the systems vulnerable until the next scheduled release.", "source_id": "d671b3b3-e499-c524-2e3c-d4490007e85f", "source_type": "PatchManagementPost", "tags": ["Office365", "PatchManagement", "SecurityUpdates", "FBXFiles"], "node_id": "83dc6e31-61f0-4310-96fb-427c801d8ee2", "metadata": {"source_ids": null, "node_label": "Symptom", "reliability": 0.85, "severity_type": "important", "entity_type": "Symptom"}, "added_at": "2025-01-03T14:44:01.981820", "last_updated": "2025-01-04T19:54:16.245860"}
