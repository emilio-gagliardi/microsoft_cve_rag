Sometimes it does not open. \nImprovements \nThis security update includes improvements. When you install this KB: \nThe update affects Active Directory domains that host mobile device management (MDM) providers. They can transition from \u201cCompatibility mode\u201d to the strong certificate mapping \u201cEnforcement mode.\u201d To do this, they can allow an Active Directory Key Distribution Center (KDC) to read user security identifiers (SID) from the Subject Alternative Name (SAN). Then, the providers can populate those values.

Servicing stack updates (SSU) ensure that you have a robust and reliable servicing stack so that your devices can receive and install Microsoft updates. \nKnown issues in this update \nSymptom \nWorkaround \nFollowing installation of this update, Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) may experience a memory leak on domain controllers (DCs). This is observed when on-premises and cloud-based Active Directory Domain Controllers service Kerberos authentication requests. \nExtreme memory leaks may cause LSASS to crash, which triggers an unscheduled reboot of underlying domain controllers (DCs). \nThis issue is addressed in  \nKB5037425 \n. \nHow to get this update \nBefore installing this update \nMicrosoft now combines the latest servicing stack update (SSU) for your operating system with the latest cumulative update (LCU).\u00a0SSUs improve the reliability of the update process to mitigate potential issues while installing the LCU. For general information about SSUs,\u00a0see  \nServicing stack updates \n\u00a0and\u00a0 \nServicing Stack Updates (SSU): Frequently Asked Questions \n. \nPrerequisite: \nYou\u00a0 \nmust\u00a0 \ninstall the August 10, 2021 SSU\u00a0( \nKB5005112 \n) before installing the LCU. \nInstall this update \nRelease Channel \nAvailable \nNext Step \nWindows Update and Microsoft Update \nYes \nNone. This update will be downloaded and installed automatically from Windows Update. \nWindows Update for Business \nYes \nNone. This update will be downloaded and installed automatically from Windows Update in accordance with configured policies. \nMicrosoft Update Catalog \nYes \nTo get the standalone package for this update, go to the\u00a0 \nMicrosoft Update Catalog \n\u00a0website. \nWindows Server Update Services (WSUS) \nYes \nThis update will automatically sync\u00a0with WSUS if you configure  \nProducts and Classifications \n as follows: \nProduct \n: Windows 10 \nClassification \n: Security Updates \nIf you want to remove the LCU \nTo remove the LCU after installing the combined SSU and LCU package, use the  \nDISM/Remove-Package \n command line option with the LCU package name as the argument. You can find the package name\u00a0by using this command:  \nDISM /online /get-packages \n. \nRunning  \nWindows Update Standalone Installer \n ( \nwusa.exe \n) with the  \n/uninstall  \nswitch on the combined package will not work because the combined package contains the SSU.
