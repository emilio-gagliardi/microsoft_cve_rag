Servicing stack updates (SSU) ensure that you have a robust and reliable servicing stack so that your devices can receive and install Microsoft updates. \nKnown issues in this update \nSymptom \nWorkaround \nUsing the  \nFixedDrivesEncryptionType \n or  \nSystemDrivesEncryptionType \n policy settings in the  \nBitLocker configuration service provider (CSP) \n node in mobile device management (MDM) apps might incorrectly show a 65000 error in the \"Require Device Encryption\" setting for some devices in your environment. Affected environments are those with the \u201cEnforce drive encryption type on operating system drives\u201d or \"Enforce drive encryption on fixed drives\" policies set to enabled and selecting either \"full encryption\" or \"used space only\". Microsoft Intune is affected by this issue but third-party MDMs might also pe affected. \nImportant \n This issue is a reporting issue only and does not affect drive encryption or the reporting of other issues on the device, including other BitLocker issues. \nTo mitigate this issue in Microsoft Intune, you can set the \u201cEnforce drive encryption type on operating system drives\u201d or \"Enforce drive encryption on fixed drives\" policies to not configured. \nWe are working on a resolution and will provide an update in an upcoming release. \nWindows devices using more than one (1) monitor might experience issues with desktop icons moving unexpectedly between monitors or other icon alignment issues when attempting to use Copilot in Windows (in preview). \nTo prevent users from encountering this issue, Copilot in Windows (in preview)\u00a0might not be available on devices that have been used or are currently being used in a multimonitor configuration. \nWe are working on a resolution and will provide an update in an upcoming release. \nCopilot in Windows (in preview) is not currently supported when your taskbar is located vertically on the right or left of your screen. \nTo access Copilot in Windows, make sure your taskbar is positioned horizontally on the top or bottom of your screen. \nWe are working on a resolution and will provide an update in an upcoming release. \nHow to get this update \nBefore installing this update \nMicrosoft now combines the latest servicing stack update (SSU) for your operating system with the latest cumulative update (LCU).\u00a0For general information about SSUs,\u00a0see  \nServicing stack updates \n\u00a0and\u00a0 \nServicing Stack Updates (SSU): Frequently Asked Questions \n. \nPrerequisite: \nBased on your installation scenario, choose one of the following: \nFor offline OS image servicing: \nIf your image does not have the\u00a0March 22, 2022 ( \nKB5011543 \n) or later LCU, you  \nmust  \ninstall the special standalone May 10, 2022 SSU ( \nKB5014032 \n) before installing this update. \nFor Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) deployment or when installing the standalone package from Microsoft Update Catalog: \nIf your devices do not have the May 11, 2021\u00a0( \nKB5003173 \n)\u00a0or later LCU, you  \nmust  \ninstall the special standalone August 10, 2021 SSU ( \nKB5005260 \n) before installing this update. \nInstall this update \nRelease Channel \nAvailable \nNext Step \nWindows Update and Microsoft Update \nYes \nNone. This update will be downloaded and installed automatically from Windows Update. \nWindows Update for Business \nYes \nNone. This update will be downloaded and installed automatically from Windows Update in accordance with configured policies. \nMicrosoft Update Catalog \nYes \nTo get the standalone package for this update, go to the\u00a0 \nMicrosoft Update Catalog \n\u00a0website. \nWindows Server Update Services (WSUS) \nYes \nThis update will automatically sync\u00a0with WSUS if you configure  \nProducts and Classifications \n as follows: \nProduct \n: Windows 10, version 1903 and later \nClassification \n: Security Updates \nIf you want to remove the LCU \nTo remove the LCU after installing the combined SSU and LCU package, use the  \nDISM/Remove-Package \n command line option with the LCU package name as the argument. You can find the package name\u00a0by using this command:  \nDISM /online /get-packages \n. \nRunning  \nWindows Update Standalone Installer \n ( \nwusa.exe \n) with the  \n/uninstall  \nswitch on the combined package will not work because the combined package contains the SSU. You cannot remove the SSU from the system after installation. \nFile information \nFor a list of the files that are provided in this update, download the\u00a0 \nfile information for cumulative update 5034122 \n. \nFor a list of the files that are provided in the servicing stack update, download the\u00a0 \nfile information for the SSU - versions 19044.3745 and 19045.3745 \n. \nSUBSCRIBE RSS FEEDS \nNeed more help? \nWant more options? \nDiscover \nCommunity \n\ue70d \nExplore subscription benefits, browse training courses, learn how to secure your device, and more. \nMicrosoft 365 subscription benefits \nMicrosoft 365 training \nMicrosoft security \nAccessibility center \nCommunities help you ask and answer questions, give feedback, and hear from experts with rich knowledge. \nAsk the Microsoft Community \nMicrosoft Tech Community \nWindows Insiders \nMicrosoft 365 Insiders \n", "published": "2024-01-09T00:00:00", "product_build_id": "b4b6fb8c-2fcd-b3ba-6cba-8697b44e71e7", "build_number": [10, 0, 19045, 3930], "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["cve_ids", "node_label", "product_build_id", "product_build_ids", "build_number", "node_id"], "article_url": "https://support.microsoft.com/help/5034122", "summary": "KB5034122, released on January 9, 2024, is a critical security update that affects Windows 10 Enterprise, Education, IoT Enterprise, and Multi-Session editions, as well as Windows 10 version 22H2 (OS Builds 19044.3930 and 19045.3930).
