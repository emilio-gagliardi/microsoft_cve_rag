The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 8.8/7.7, with a high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. It is remotely exploitable over the network without requiring user privileges. An attacker could execute arbitrary code by tricking an authenticated victim into connecting to a malicious SQL database. Microsoft released security updates in January 2024 to address this issue, which were inadvertently omitted from the initial release but have been rectified. Customers who have installed the January 2024 updates are not required to take further action. System administrators are advised to apply the provided security updates to mitigate the risk of exploitation and protect their systems from potential remote code execution attacks.", "impact_type": "Remote Code Execution", "severity_type": "important", "etl_processing_status": {"document_processed": true, "nvd_extracted": true, "entities_extracted": true, "graph_prepared": true, "vector_prepared": false, "last_processed_at": "2025-01-07T00:05:44.629003", "processing_version": "1.0"}, "doc_id": "a7b5d802-2599-fa4d-4ef4-46289544a9c0", "embedding": null, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["added_to_graph_store", "patterns_found", "patterns_missing", "added_to_summary_index", "tags", "unique_tokens", "build_numbers", "source", "kb_ids", "email_text_original", "product_build_ids", "added_to_vector_store", "node_label", "description", "cve_mentions", "id", "cve_fixes"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["id", "added_to_vector_store", "added_to_summary_index", "added_to_graph_store", "cve_fixes", "cve_mentions", "email_text_original", "unique_tokens", "tags"], "kb_ids": ["KB-5034763"], "cve_category": "remote_code_execution", "node_label": "MSRCPost", "adp_base_score_rating": null, "nist_integrity": null, "adp_base_score_num": null, "adp_scope": null, "cna_scope": "unchanged", "nist_base_score": null, "cna_attack_complexity": "low", "nvd_published_date": "2024-02-13T00:00:00", "adp_attack_complexity": null, "nist_confidentiality": null, "adp_impact_score": null, "nist_impact_score": null, "cna_attack_vector": "network", "adp_privileges_required": null, "cwe_source": "Microsoft Corporation", "cna_vector": "av:n/ac:l/pr:n/ui:r/s:u/c:h/i:h/a:h", "cna_user_interaction": "required", "cna_base_score": 8.8, "adp_attack_vector": null, "nist_scope": null, "nist_attack_complexity": null, "adp_integrity": null, "cna_integrity": "high", "adp_availability": null, "adp_user_interaction": null, "nist_user_interaction": null, "cna_exploitability_score": 2.8, "cna_impact_score": 5.9, "cwe_name": "Numeric Truncation Error", "nvd_description": "microsoft wdac ole db provider for sql server remote code execution vulnerability", "nist_attack_vector": null, "cna_base_score_num": 8.8, "nist_privileges_required": null, "cna_availability": "high", "adp_vector": null, "adp_exploitability_score": null, "adp_base_score": null, "nist_exploitability_score": null, "nist_availability": null, "cna_privileges_required": null, "adp_confidentiality": null, "nist_base_score_num": null, "nist_vector": null, "cwe_url": "http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/197.html", "cna_confidentiality": "high", "cwe_id": "CWE-197", "nist_base_score_rating": null, "cna_base_score_rating": "high", "reliability": "HIGH", "readability": "HIGH", "cve_ids": [], "product_mentions": [], "extracted_symptoms": ["17fbc612-bce5-4578-872b-84215811c0d1"], "extracted_causes": ["c2172437-a637-4a7a-9876-33eb60fcee48"], "extracted_fixes": ["723434c9-24ca-4226-9eb9-1d9b4bce67ff"], "extracted_tools": [], "added_at": "2025-01-07T00:38:20.136348", "last_updated": "2025-01-07T00:38:20.136348"}
