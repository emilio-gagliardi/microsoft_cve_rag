This is an informational change only. \nWindows Kernel Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability \nOn this page \n\ue70d \nCVE-2023-36698 \nSecurity Vulnerability \nReleased: Oct 10, 2023 Last updated: Nov 6, 2023 \nAssigning CNA: \nMicrosoft \nCVE-2023-36698  \n\uf35f \nImpact: Security Feature Bypass \nMax Severity: Important \nCVSS:3.1 4.4 / 3.9 \n\ue946 \nBase score metrics: 4.4 / Temporal score metrics: 3.9 \nBase score metrics: 4.4 / Temporal score metrics: 3.9 \n\ue96e \nExpand all \n\ue970 \nCollapse all \nMetric \nValue \n\ue8ec \n\ue974 \nBase score metrics \n(8) \nAttack Vector \n \nLocal \nThe vulnerable component is not bound to the network stack and the attacker\u2019s path is via read/write/execute capabilities. Either: the attacker exploits the vulnerability by accessing the target system locally (e.g., keyboard, console), or remotely (e.g., SSH); or the attacker relies on User Interaction by another person to perform actions required to exploit the vulnerability (e.g., tricking a legitimate user into opening a malicious document) \nAttack Complexity \nThis metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker\u2019s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration. \nLow \nSpecialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success against the vulnerable component. \nPrivileges Required \n \nLow \nThe attacker is authorized with (i.e., requires) privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges may have the ability to cause an impact only to non-sensitive resources. \nUser Interaction \n \nNone \nThe vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user. \nScope \n \nUnchanged \nAn exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority. \nConfidentiality \n \nNone \nThere is no loss of confidentiality within the impacted component. \nIntegrity \n \nLow \nModification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component. \nAvailability \n \nLow \nPerformance is reduced or there are interruptions in resource availability. Even if repeated exploitation of the vulnerability is possible, the attacker does not have the ability to completely deny service to legitimate users. The resources in the impacted component are either partially available all of the time, or fully available only some of the time, but overall there is no direct, serious consequence to the impacted component. \n\ue8ec \n\ue974 \nTemporal score metrics \n(3) \nExploit Code Maturity \nThis metric measures the likelihood of the vulnerability being attacked, and is typically based on the current state of exploit techniques, exploit code availability, or active, 'in-the-wild' exploitation. \nUnproven \nNo exploit code is available, or an exploit is theoretical. \nRemediation Level \n \nOfficial Fix \nA complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. \nReport Confidence \n \nConfirmed \nDetailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this). Source code is available to independently verify the assertions of the research, or the author or vendor of the affected code has confirmed the presence of the vulnerability. \nPlease see  \nCommon Vulnerability Scoring System \n for more information on the definition of these metrics. \nThe following table provides an  \nexploitability assessment \n for this vulnerability at the time of original publication. \nPublicly disclosed \nExploited \nExploitability assessment \nNo \nNo \nExploitation Less Likely \nWhat kind of security feature could be bypassed by successfully exploiting this vulnerability? \nAn attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could bypass the Windows Arbitrary Code Guard exploit protection feature. \nAccording to the CVSS metric, successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to some loss of integrity (I:L) and some loss of availability (A:L). What does that mean for this vulnerability? \nAn attacker can craft a malicious file that would bypass the Arbitrary Code Guard (ACG) exploit protection feature. However, after ACG is bypassed, while the data processed or protected can't be fully trusted, the attacker does not have full control over an exploited component with only this bypass. As a result, confidentiality of information resources managed by Windows is not in itself compromised (C:N), but both system integrity (I:L) and system availability (A:L) might experience limited compromises by this bypass. \nFor more on this feature please see:  \nArbitrary code guard \n. \nziming zhang \n with Ant Security Light-Year Lab \nMicrosoft recognizes the efforts of those in the security community who help us protect customers through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.
