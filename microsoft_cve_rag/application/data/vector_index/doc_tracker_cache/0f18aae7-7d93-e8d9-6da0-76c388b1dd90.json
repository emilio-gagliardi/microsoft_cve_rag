Learn why this is important\n[https://aka.ms/LearnAboutSenderIdentification] \nHistorically we have been using Intune to manage the availability\u00a0of feature and\ndriver updates. This has worked well for feature updates for a few years now and\nfor driver updates for a few months. \nAround December we noticed that new drivers stopped\u00a0populating in Intune for us\nto approve. Then in mid January we began testing upgrading from Windows 11 22H2\nto Windows 11 23H2. In the past once the feature update was in place, the device\nwould get it pretty fast, no more than a day or two. This time, nothing. Nothing\nin the Intune reports as well. \nFast forward through two tickets with Microsoft support, dozens of logs being\ncollected, creating and deleting feature and driver update policies and I\ndecided to take a peek into our tenant's Graph. There I found old driver\npolicies from December, which were already deleted from Intune weeks ago. Zero\nfeature update policies were listed, even though I have three active policies in\nIntune. Basically, Intune has stopped communicating with Graph and the Windows\nUpdate for Business Deployment Service. \nLast night, in Graph, I cleared out any old policies and created a new feature\nupdate deployment and assigned a few devices to its deployment audience. I'm\ngoing to let that sit for a few days and see if it works. There are still some\n(old?) deployment audiences that Graph will not let me delete. \nFYI quality updates work and I still see data in my Windows Updates for Business\nAzure workbook. \nMicrosoft has not been helpful, stating they cannot check the health of our\ntenant's Graph. \nAny Graph experts here who might know what the heck is going on with us? \nTake care, \nAnthony Meluso\nDirector of Technology\nWatchung Hills Regional High School\n108 Stirling Rd.\nWarren, NJ 07059\n908-647-4800 Ext. 4962 \n--\nLink: https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/patchmanagement/CAPEMYtHR2GL%3DxZFVJvArH5eE_qEKwxx7_3nBsYaLvchSiMS7Fg%40mail.gmail.com \n", "evaluated_keywords": "['new driver stop populate', 'new feature update deployment', 'windows 11 23h2', 'windows 11 22h2']", "evaluated_noun_chunks": "['the availability, feature and driver updates', 'feature and driver update policies', 'Windows Update for Business Deployment Service', 'the health of our tenant\\'s Graph']", "post_type": "Problem statement", "unique_tokens": 180, "product_build_ids": [], "thread_id": "issues_intune_windows_update_business_deployment_service", "previous_id": null, "next_id": null, "etl_processing_status": {"document_processed": true, "entities_extracted": true, "graph_prepared": false, "vector_prepared": true, "last_processed_at": "2025-01-07T00:05:44.759015", "processing_version": "1.0"}, "doc_id": "0f18aae7-7d93-e8d9-6da0-76c388b1dd90", "noun_chunks": "['the availability, feature and driver updates', 'feature and driver update policies', 'Windows Update for Business Deployment Service', 'the health of our tenant\\'s Graph']", "keywords": "['new driver stop populate', 'new feature update deployment', 'windows 11 23h2', 'windows 11 22h2']", "node_label": "PatchManagementPost", "kb_ids": [], "cve_ids": "", "embedding": null, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["id", "added_to_vector_store", "added_to_summary_index", "added_to_graph_store", "cve_fixes", "cve_mentions", "email_text_original", "unique_tokens", "tags"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["id", "added_to_vector_store", "added_to_summary_index", "added_to_graph_store", "cve_fixes", "cve_mentions", "email_text_original", "unique_tokens", "tags"], "build_numbers": [], "product_mentions": [], "is_processed": false, "reliability": "", "readability": "", "extracted_symptoms": ["b395071d-d41f-4c9c-a7f6-b09fb531f14e"], "extracted_causes": [], "extracted_fixes": [], "extracted_tools": [], "added_at": "2025-01-07T00:39:51.180239", "last_updated": "2025-01-07T00:39:51.180239"}
