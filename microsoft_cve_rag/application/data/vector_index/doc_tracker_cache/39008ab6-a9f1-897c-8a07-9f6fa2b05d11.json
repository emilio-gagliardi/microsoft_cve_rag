I use Action1 with a policy setup to look for updates on a daily basis. When the action one tool finds an update, I can either set it to ask me for approval, or I can set it to just go ahead and run the update. When you use a tool such as the one that I do, it may be a little bit of extra work in the beginning to get everything set up, but in the long run it saves you hours of work. Another great thing about action One is they have a vulnerability scanner built into their tool as well. So if there is a CVE alert for a piece of software on the computer, it will let me know, with suggestions on how to fix it. The term work smarter not harder can be used here. Why manually do all these checks and updates, when you can use a free tool such as action 1 to do it for you?
