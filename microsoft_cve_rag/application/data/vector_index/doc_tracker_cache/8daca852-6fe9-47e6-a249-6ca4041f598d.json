{"tool_label": "DisableWindowsCopilotInEdge", "description": "A command-line registry modification tool using reg.exe to disable Windows Copilot system-wide and in Microsoft Edge. The first command adds a DWORD value to prevent Windows Copilot from functioning, addressing the issue that default settings are insufficient to completely disable it in all configurations. The second command is intended to disable the sidebar feature in Edge by modifying its registry setting. While they are designed to mitigate the impact of unwanted features, further testing in actual environments is recommended to validate effectiveness.", "source_id": "e508a88a-dbc9-43ee-a9d3-21d319158b1a", "source_type": "PatchManagementPost", "tool_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SCCM/comments/...", "tags": ["registry", "command-line", "Windows Copilot", "Edge", "LLMSynthesized"], "node_id": "8daca852-6fe9-47e6-a249-6ca4041f598d", "metadata": {"source_url": "//groups.google.com/d/msgid/patchmanagement/...", "node_label": "Tool", "reliability": "0.6", "severity_type": "moderate", "entity_type": "Tool", "synthesized_code": null}, "added_at": "2024-12-30T14:37:44.520977", "last_updated": "2024-12-30T14:37:44.520977"}
