Looking in our RMM history, I see were some did get November\nCU, but it was not being offered anymore. \nThey were being offered the upgrade to 23H2. We\u2019re not quite ready for that, and\nit\u2019s not being pushed with our RMM. \nBottom line these machines are not being offered November, and we\u2019re not pushing\n23h2; something needs to give. \nI changed the Target version, and checked for updates again, and the November\nupdates were being offered. \n[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\WindowsUpdate] \n\"ProductVersion\"=\"Windows 11\" \n\"TargetReleaseVersion\"=dword:00000001 \n\"TargetReleaseVersionInfo\"=\"22H2\" \nIf I recall, Windows 10 did not act like this. CUs would be offered, even if the\nnext version was available (or even targeted), but maybe I\u2019m wrong. \nThanks,\nShimon \nImage removed by sender.
