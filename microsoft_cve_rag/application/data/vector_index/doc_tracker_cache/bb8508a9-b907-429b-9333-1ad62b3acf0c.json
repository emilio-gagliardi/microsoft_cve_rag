{"symptom_label": "WindowsUpdateFailsDueToInsufficientRecoverySpace", "description": "The recent Windows update fails to apply successfully on the majority of systems due to inadequate space in the recovery partition. A standard Windows installation typically provides a recovery partition with around 100 MB of free space. This poses a problem for organizations that rely on the default configuration, as the update does not automatically resize the recovery partition, which is critical for accommodating the additional requirements of the update process.", "source_id": "a5d33d2b-0aef-a882-d77c-7cb11b249d9e", "source_type": "PatchManagementPost", "tags": ["WindowsUpdate", "RecoveryPartition", "InsufficientSpace", "PatchFailure"], "node_id": "bb8508a9-b907-429b-9333-1ad62b3acf0c", "metadata": {"node_label": "Symptom", "reliability": 0.85, "severity_type": "important", "entity_type": "Symptom"}, "added_at": "2025-01-03T16:00:59.171465", "last_updated": "2025-01-03T16:00:59.171465"}
