The\nEnterprise SSO Plug-in enables SSO for applications and resources protected by\nMicrosoft Entra ID. \nImpact is specific to the following operating system versions: \niOS/iPadOS 17.1.x \nMacOS 14.1.x \nAdmins should be advised that using these versions of either iOS, iPadOS, or\nmacOS will render the Enterprise SSO Plug-in inoperable when browser SSO is\nused. As a result, users may not be able to successfully sign-in to applications\nand resources that leverage browser SSO, such as web portals, cloud services,\nand native applications that use the Safari WebView, such as Apple Mail. \nThis regression has been found to have an outsized impact on Entra ID\ndeployments that use third-party mobile device management (MDM) solutions, due\nto a lack of redundant fallback mechanisms for SSO. \nWhile the new operating system versions from Apple contain enhancements and\nsecurity fixes unrelated to the Enterprise SSO plug-in, they also introduce a\nregression that affects browser SSO functionality. Therefore, we advise you to\nevaluate upgrading to these versions carefully, based on your organizational\nsecurity policies and the criticality of using the Enterprise SSO extension\nwithin your organization. You may want to postpone upgrading until a resolution\nis available from Apple or use alternative methods of authentication for\naccessing applications and resources that rely on browser SSO. \nIf you are using Intune as your MDM solution, you can use it to prevent\noperating system version updates for devices under management.
