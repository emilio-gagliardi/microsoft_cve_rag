This vulnerability is classified as a security feature\nbypass with a high severity level, carrying a CVSS score of 9.0 / 7.8. It poses\na significant risk by potentially allowing unauthorized impersonation and\nexploitation of the authentication feature. \nTo exploit this vulnerability, an unauthenticated attacker would need to\ninitiate a machine-in-the-middle (MITM) attack or employ a similar local network\nspoofing technique. By gaining control, the attacker can send a malicious\nKerberos message to the target machine, posing as the Kerberos authentication\nserver. \nAccording to the CVSS metric, the attack vector for this vulnerability is\ncategorized as \u201cadjacent\u201d (AV:A), indicating that the attacker must first gain\naccess to a restricted network to launch the attack successfully. \nMoreover, successful exploitation could result in a scope change (S:C). This\nindicates that the vulnerability\u2019s impact extends beyond the security scope\nmanaged by the authority responsible for the affected component, affecting\ncomponents managed by different security authorities. \nAs of the original publication date, there is no known exploit code available.\nThe recommended course of action is to apply the official fix as a remediation\nmeasure. \nGoogle Chrome \nGoogle has swiftly issued emergency updates in response to an actively exploited\ncritical vulnerability, marking the eighth zero-day flaw addressed in Chrome\nwithin a year. Detailed in their security advisory for CVE-2023-7024, the\ncompany acknowledges the existence of a functional exploit. \nThis high-severity issue, identified as CVE-2023-7024, stems from a heap buffer\noverflow within the WebRTC platform, a component also used in other browsers\nsuch as Mozilla Firefox, Safari, and Microsoft Edge. Researchers Cl\u00e9ment Lesigne\nand Vlad Stolyarov from Google\u2019s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) uncovered this\nflaw. The active exploitation of this vulnerability suggests potential\ninvolvement in advanced persistent threat (APT) activities or spyware campaigns. \nWhile specific details of the attacks remain undisclosed, Google\u2019s rapid\nresponse saw updates released just a day after the bug\u2019s report. These updates\nare available for Windows (versions 120.0.6099.129/130) and for Mac and Linux\n(version 120.0.6099.129). \nGoogle Web Toolkit \nThe Google Web Toolkit (GWT) Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability has been\na persistent security concern, unaddressed for over eight years, leaving\nnumerous applications exposed to server-side risks. The Google Web Toolkit, an\nopen-source tool used by around 2,000 software companies according to Enlyft,\nenables web developers to create and manage JavaScript interface applications in\nJava. \nDespite its disclosure in 2015, the critical unauthenticated Java\ndeserialization bug in the Google Web Toolkit platform remains unresolved. This\noversight suggests that significant infrastructure modifications might be\nnecessary for the future security of affected applications. \nA comprehensive study by Bishop Fox delves into the specifics of the GWT\nvulnerability. The report not only details the vulnerability but also\ndemonstrates its practical application in software and discusses possible\ncountermeasures. The researchers draw parallels between the GWT issue and the\nSpring4Shell vulnerability identified in 2022, pointing out the negligence of\ncode developers in addressing these vulnerabilities, including a lack of manual\nupdates to the framework. \nBishop Fox highlights the complexity of mitigating the risks associated with\nvulnerable web applications. Given the fundamental nature of the bug,\nsafeguarding applications developed using the framework might necessitate\nsubstantial changes either to the applications themselves or to the framework\u2019s\narchitecture. \nHowever, the study does offer some interim measures for mitigation, providing a\nstarting point for addressing this longstanding security flaw. \nMozilla Firefox \nMozilla has addressed 27 security vulnerabilities in Firefox version 121,\nenhancing the browser\u2019s security. Among these, 13 vulnerabilities, notably\ndangerous, have been identified. Eleven of these are collectively categorized\nunder CVE-2023-6864 and CVE-2023-6873. These vulnerabilities stem from\nmemory-related issues, such as buffer overflows and accessing previously freed\nmemory areas. Such flaws could potentially enable the execution of malicious\ncode when a user visits specially crafted web pages. \nAdditionally, a critical vulnerability, designated as CVE-2023-6135, concerns\nthe susceptibility of the NSS library to the \u201cMinerva\u201d attack. This specific\nattack method involves the recovery of a private key by analyzing data through\nindirect channels, posing a significant security risk. \nApache Open Office \nThe latest version of the Apache OpenOffice suite, 4.1.15, addresses four\nvulnerabilities, which were not initially mentioned in the changelog and\ndisclosed only a few days post-release. \nThe first vulnerability, CVE-2023-1183, poses a risk by allowing data to be\nwritten to any file on the system, subject to access permissions. This can occur\nwhen OBD (Office Binder Document) files, formatted in a specific way, are opened\nin OpenOffice Base. The exploit involves using the SCRIPT command in a\n\u201cdatabase/script\u201d file within the document, enabling the attacker to specify a\nfile path where the content gets written. \nAnother vulnerability, CVE-2012-5639, concerns the automatic downloading and\nopening of internal or external resources without user notification. Initially\nidentified in LibreOffice in 2012 and mistakenly marked as a non-issue, it was\nlater resolved in LibreOffice 4.2 in 2014. However, this vulnerability remained\nunaddressed in OpenOffice until now. \nCVE-2022-43680 represents a potential threat where a remote attacker could\nexecute code through specially crafted documents, particularly in low-memory\nsituations. This vulnerability stems from a use-after-free memory access error\nin the libexpat library, which is used for XML data parsing. The issue has been\nrectified in libexpat version 2.4.9. \nThe final vulnerability, CVE-2023-47804, introduces a new attack vector related\nto the previously patched CVE-2022-47502 in OpenOffice 4.1.14. It allows an\nattacker to embed a link in a document that triggers the execution of a macro\nwith arbitrary arguments. This script execution can occur upon user interaction\nwith the link or automatically through document-associated events, without\nrequiring user confirmation. \n[https://www.action1.com/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/doc-root/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Third-party-tips-website-banner.png.webp]\n\nApache OFBiz \nA critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in Apache OFBiz is\ncurrently being exploited, with publicly available Proof of Concepts (PoCs)\naiding the attacks. \nApache OFBiz, an open-source Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system, is\nwidely used by various companies for e-commerce, human resources, and accounting\nmanagement. It is a crucial part of the supply chain, impacting software like\nAtlassian\u2019s JIRA, which over 120,000 companies globally rely on. \nThis vulnerability, identified as CVE-2023-49070, was initially patched in the\nOFBiz version 18.12.10, released on December 5, 2023. The bug allows\nunauthorized privilege escalation, arbitrary code execution, and access to\nsensitive data. However, SonicWall researchers discovered that the root cause of\nCVE-2023-49070 remains unaddressed in the patched version, leaving it\nsusceptible to exploitation. \nSonicWall\u2019s report outlines methods to circumvent Apache\u2019s patch for\nCVE-2023-49070, exploiting specific credential combinations. The vulnerability\noriginates from a flaw in handling empty or special parameters. After SonicWall\ncommunicated their findings, Apache quickly addressed the issue, categorizing it\nas a Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) problem. \nThis newly identified bypass issue was assigned CVE-2023-51467 and was fixed in\nOFBiz version 18.12.11, released on December 26, 2023. Despite the availability\nof this update, many users have not yet upgraded, and the widespread\navailability of PoC exploits for pre-authenticated RCEs makes this vulnerability\nhighly appealing to attackers. The Shadowserver Foundation has observed\nextensive scanning activities using these PoCs, targeting vulnerabilities like\nCVE-2023-49070, and anticipates similar patterns for CVE-2023-51467. The primary\ntarget of these attacks is the vulnerable Confluence software. \nApache OFBiz users are strongly encouraged to update to version 18.12.11\npromptly to reduce their risk of exploitation. \nApache Struts \nShadowserver has reported the exploitation of a critical path traversal\nvulnerability in Apache Struts, identified as CVE-2023-50164. This Remote Code\nExecution (RCE) vulnerability impacts multiple versions of Struts, including\n2.0.0 \u2013 2.3.37, 2.5.0 \u2013 2.5.32, and 6.0.0 \u2013 6.3.0. Apache has issued patches for\nthis vulnerability in versions 6.3.0.2 and 2.5.33 on December 7. Successful\nexploitation of this vulnerability can lead to unauthorized server access,\nsensitive data theft, disruption of critical services, and lateral movement\nwithin compromised networks. \nAs of now, only a limited number of IP addresses have been observed engaging in\nexploitation attempts. However, a more significant wave of attacks is\nanticipated. This expectation stems from the fact that on December 10, technical\ndetails about the vulnerability were leaked, along with the release of a\npublicly available Proof of Concept (PoC) exploit. The availability of this\ninformation is likely to increase the vulnerability\u2019s exploitation by malicious\nactors. \nBarracuda ESG \nBarracuda and Mandiant have reported the active exploitation of two zero-day\nvulnerabilities by a Chinese APT group, UNC4841, with the primary vulnerability\nremaining unpatched. \nThe key vulnerability is designated as CVE-2023-7101, involving an arbitrary\ncode execution issue in the third-party library Spreadsheet::ParseExcel, a Perl\nmodule for parsing Excel files. The flaw arises from the handling of unverified\ninput data from a file by the \u2018eval\u2019 function as a string. Specifically, this\nvulnerability is linked to the processing of numeric format strings in Excel\u2019s\nparsing logic. \nThe second vulnerability, labeled CVE-2023-7102, is found in a library used in\nthe firmware of Barracuda\u2019s ESG appliances and is considered a separate bug. \nUpon successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities, UNC4841 managed to deploy\nnew variants of the SEASPY and SALTWATER malware on a limited number of ESG\nappliances. In response, Barracuda released a patch on December 22, 2023, to\naddress the compromised ESG devices showing indicators of the identified malware\nvariants. While Barracuda has restricted the functionality of the vulnerable\nlibrary in its ESG appliance, the primary issue, CVE-2023-7101, in the\nopen-source library remains unpatched. \nOrganizations utilizing the Spreadsheet::ParseExcel library are advised to\nassess the impact of CVE-2023-7101 and implement immediate remediation measures.\nExperts believe that the APT group, UNC4841, may still possess additional\nundisclosed zero-day vulnerabilities, which could be strategically employed in\ntargeted attacks against significant entities. \nApple \nThe narrative of last year\u2019s most infamous cyberattack is reaching its\nconclusion, revealing that vulnerabilities and exploits to bypass iPhone\nhardware security mechanisms were due to undocumented features in Apple chips,\nfrom A12 to A16 Bionic. The comprehensive reverse-engineering of the attack\nchain led to the patching of most firmware vulnerabilities. Many of these\nvulnerabilities were exploited due to features left in the firmware for testing,\ndebugging, or accidentally during manufacturing. \nLabelled as Operation Triangulation, this campaign is considered one of the most\nsophisticated attack chains in history. Kaspersky Lab researchers spent a year\ndissecting the attack, striving to unravel all aspects of this cyber espionage\ncampaign first discovered in early 2023. \nIn their investigation, researchers also analyzed previously known zero-days and\nunveiled a notable iOS device feature, assigned CVE-2023-38606, patched on July\n24 with iOS/iPadOS 16.6 release. Attackers exploited undocumented\nfunctionalities in Apple processors, which, while unused in iOS code, enabled\nthem to bypass hardware protections and seize complete device control.\nSpecifically, CVE-2023-38606 exploits unknown MMIO registers in Apple\u2019s A12-A16\nBionic chips, likely linked to the graphic coprocessor. This vulnerability\nallows manipulation of hardware functions and control over direct memory access.\nResearchers speculate that this undocumented feature\u2019s inclusion in iPhones was\neither an oversight or intended for Apple engineers\u2019 debugging and testing. \nYet, many questions about CVE-2023-38606 remain unanswered, including how\nattackers discovered this feature and its original intent, and whether Apple or\na third party developed it. This case underscores that systems relying on\n\u201csecurity by obscurity\u201d cannot guarantee absolute security. \nIn response to these findings, Apple has released security updates for iOS,\niPadOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS, and Safari, addressing multiple new\nvulnerabilities, including critical ones. The iOS and iPadOS updates fix 12\nvulnerabilities, with the most severe being a memory corruption issue in\nImageIO. macOS Sonoma 14.2 patches 39 bugs, including a critical Bluetooth\nvulnerability (CVE-2023-45866) allowing network-based keystroke injection. \nAdditionally, Safari 17.2 addresses two WebKit bugs leading to potential RCE and\nDoS attacks. These updates cover devices running macOS Monterey and Ventura. iOS\n17.2 and iPadOS 17.2 not only fix a Siri vulnerability but also introduce a new\ncontact key verification feature in iMessage, enhancing privacy and countering\nserver infrastructure abuse by spyware and APT vendors. \nLinux \nIn December, a local vulnerability in the Linux kernel, exploitable through\nnftables, was addressed. This vulnerability, identified as CVE-2023-6817, was\nfound in the netfilter subsystem and could allow a local user to escalate\nprivileges on the system. The issue originates from a use-after-free memory\naccess in the nf_tables module, responsible for the nftables packet filter. \nThe vulnerability is present in Linux kernel versions starting from 5.6. A\nresolution for this issue was proposed in the 6.7-rc5 testing release of the\nLinux kernel and has since been integrated into the current stable branches,\nincluding versions 5.10.204, 5.15.143, 6.1.68, and 6.6.7. \nSpecifically, the vulnerability stems from a flaw in the nft_pipapo_walk\nfunction. This function, involved in the Pile Packet Policies (PIPAPO) item\nlookup process, fails to properly check for duplicates, leading to the erroneous\nrelease of memory. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker requires access to\nnftables, achievable with CAP_NET_ADMIN privileges in any user or network\nnamespace, such as those found in isolated containers. \nFor testing purposes, a prototype exploit has been developed and released,\nallowing client systems to assess their vulnerability to this security flaw. \nESET \nA serious vulnerability in the secure traffic scanning feature of ESET\u2019s\nendpoint security products has been disclosed by an anonymous researcher. \nThis vulnerability, designated as CVE-2023-5594 and rated 7.5 on the CVSS scale,\naffects the way ESET\u2019s products monitor SSL/TLS protocol scans. Specifically, it\nleads to browsers trusting sites with certificates signed by outdated algorithms\nthat are considered untrustworthy. \nThe root cause of this issue is the improper validation of the server\ncertificate chain. ESET\u2019s system erroneously regarded an intermediate\ncertificate signed using MD5 or SHA1 as trustworthy. As a result, a browser on a\nsystem with ESET Secure Traffic Scanning enabled could erroneously trust a site\nsecured with such a certificate. \nThe range of affected products is extensive, including NOD32 Antivirus, Internet\nSecurity, Smart Security Premium, Security Ultimate, Endpoint Antivirus,\nEndpoint Security, Server Security, Mail Security, Security for Microsoft\nSharePoint Server, and File Security for Microsoft Azure. \nESET has addressed this vulnerability and is deploying patches as part of an\nautomatic update, beginning November 21. Users do not need to take any action to\ninstall this patch. \nAs per ESET\u2019s statement, there have been no observed attacks exploiting this\nvulnerability. \nIvanti \nIvanti customers are facing yet another update requirement following a series of\nrecent incidents. Adding a somewhat ironic twist, exactly thirteen new critical\nRemote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities have been identified, a number that\nmight unsettle the superstitious. \nThese vulnerabilities impact Ivanti\u2019s Avalanche mobile device management (MDM)\nsolution. As detailed by Ivanti, these security issues were identified by\nTenable researchers as part of the Zero Day Initiative. They involve the\nWLAvalancheService stack and a heap-based buffer overflow. \nAll supported versions of the product, specifically Avalanche version 6.3.1 and\nlater, are affected. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by unauthenticated\nattackers in low-complexity attacks, which do not require user interaction. Such\nattacks could lead to remote code execution or trigger a Denial of Service (DoS)\ncondition on systems that have not been patched. Additionally, Ivanti has\npatched eight other vulnerabilities ranging from moderate to high severity,\nwhich could be exploited for DoS, remote code execution, and server-side request\nforgery (SSRF). \nIvanti has addressed all discovered vulnerabilities in Avalanche v6.4.2.313.\nCustomers are strongly advised to download the Avalanche installer and upgrade\nto this latest version. \nHowever, given the sheer number of issues, there\u2019s a significant concern that\nadvanced attackers might have already exploited these vulnerabilities. This\nraises the specter of a potential new major security breach, reminiscent of the\n\u201cNorwegian\u201d case, looming on the horizon. \nOpenSSH \nResearchers at Ruhr-Universit\u00e4t Bochum have unveiled a new prefix truncation\nattack named Terrapin, compromising the integrity of OpenSSH connections under\nspecific encryption modes. \nTerrapin exploits vulnerabilities in the SSH transport layer protocol,\nleveraging cryptographic algorithms and encryption modes introduced by OpenSSH\nover a decade ago. This attack allows modification of messages in the channel,\nleading to less secure client authentication algorithms and disabling protection\nagainst keystroke timing attacks in OpenSSH 9.5. \nThe bugs related to this attack are identified as CVE-2023-48795,\nCVE-2023-46445, and CVE-2023-46446. Attackers need to be in a Man-in-the-Middle\n(MiTM) position at the network layer to intercept and manipulate the handshake\nexchange. The connection must be secured using either ChaCha20-Poly1305 or CBC\nwith encryption, then MAC. The content of messages exchanged post-handshake\ninfluences the attack\u2019s severity. \nDespite specific conditions required for Terrapin, the prevalent use of these\nencryption modes (77% as per scans) makes the attack a realistic threat. Vendors\nare progressively addressing this issue, with one solution being the\nimplementation of strict key exchange, which prevents packet injection during\nthe handshake. However, this countermeasure is only effective when implemented\non both the client and server side. \nThe research team has made available a vulnerability scanner named Terrapin on\nGitHub, enabling administrators to assess if their SSH client or server is\nsusceptible to this attack. Addressing Terrapin is not a straightforward\nsoftware update; both clients and servers require updates to safeguard against\nprefix truncation attacks. \nCurrently, the necessity for a MiTM position to execute Terrapin lessens its\nimmediate threat, which may lead to CVE-2023-48795 not being a top priority for\npatching in some instances. Detailed information on the Terrapin attack is\navailable in the technical report. \nTo remedy the Terrapin vulnerability and other issues, OpenSSH 9.6 has been\nreleased. This update addresses three security concerns: \n* * CVE-2023-48795 (the \u201cTerrapin\u201d attack): This vulnerability in the SSH\n protocol allows a MITM attack to downgrade the connection to use less\n secure authentication algorithms and disables protection against\n third-party input reconstruction attacks.\n * A vulnerability in the ssh utility: This issue allows for the substitution\n of arbitrary shell commands by manipulating login and host values with\n special characters. It can be exploited under certain conditions, such as\n systems using Git submodules.\n * A bug in ssh-agent: This issue affects the application of restrictions,\n only applying them to the first key returned by a PKCS#11 token when adding\n PKCS#11 private keys. This does not impact regular private keys or FIDO\n tokens and keys set without restrictions. \nPerforce Helix Core Server \nMicrosoft has identified a critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in\nPerforce Helix Core Server, a source code management platform extensively\nutilized in the gaming, government, military, and technology sectors. Alongside\nthis, three other vulnerabilities related to Denial of Service (DoS) have been\ndetected. \nTo address these issues, Microsoft advises users to upgrade to version\n2023.1/2513900 of Perforce Helix Core Server, released on November 7, 2023. \nThe most severe of these vulnerabilities is CVE-2023-45849, which has been\nassigned a CVSS score of 10. This vulnerability poses a significant threat, as\nit could enable an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code with\nLocalSystem privileges. Such access would allow the attacker to reach local\nresources and system files, alter registry settings, and potentially cause\nfurther system compromises. \nFor enhanced protection, Microsoft recommends implementing additional security\nmeasures. These include restricting access to the Perforce Server through the\nuse of VPNs or IP whitelisting, employing TLS proxy certificates for user\nauthentication, meticulously logging all accesses to the Perforce Server, and\napplying network segmentation strategies to contain and control any potential\nbreaches. These proactive steps aim to fortify the security posture against such\nvulnerabilities. \nDell \nDell has addressed eight vulnerabilities in its PowerProtect DD solutions,\nseveral of which are rated as high severity. These vulnerabilities impact a\nrange of products, including PowerProtect Data Domain (DD) Series appliances,\nAPEX Protect Storage, PowerProtect DD Management Center, PowerProtect DP Series\nappliances, and PowerProtect Data Manager. \nThe most critical vulnerability, assigned a CVSS score of 8.8, is\nCVE-2023-44286. This is a DOM-based cross-site scripting vulnerability, which\nenables a remote, unauthorized attacker to inject malicious HTML or JavaScript\ncode into a victim\u2019s browser DOM environment. Successful exploitation of this\nvulnerability could lead to client-side request forgery, session theft, and\ninformation disclosure. \nIn addition to CVE-2023-44286, there are several other high-severity\nvulnerabilities related to operating system command injection and access control\nflaws. The command injection flaws present a risk of arbitrary command execution\non the underlying operating system with the privileges of the vulnerable\napplication, potentially allowing an attacker to take control of the target\nsystem. While exploitation typically requires local access and either low or\nelevated privileges, an attacker could potentially leverage a vulnerability like\nCVE-2023-44286 to meet authentication requirements. \nFurthermore, three moderate vulnerabilities were identified in PowerProtect\nproducts. These could be exploited by an authenticated attacker to circumvent\nsecurity restrictions and gain control of the system, obtain read and write\naccess to operating system files, and execute arbitrary SQL commands on the\napplication\u2019s server database, resulting in read access. \nDell Technologies urges customers to review the DSA-2023-412 advisory and apply\nthe necessary updates. While there has been no observed exploitation of these\nvulnerabilities, solutions from the vendor have been targeted by Lazarus APTs in\nthe past year. Hence, it\u2019s crucial for users to stay vigilant and ensure their\nsystems are up to date with the latest security patches.", "metadata": {"id": "1f418ca7-f775-9ff1-c8b0-90ed4a934241", "receivedDateTime": "2024-01-09T18:21:31+00:00", "topic": "Patch Tuesday Roundup by Action1", "subject": "[patchmanagement] Patch Tuesday Roundup by Action1", "published": "2024-01-09T00:00:00", "collection": "patch_management", "cve_fixes": "", "cve_mentions": null, "tags": "", "conversation_link": "//groups.google.com/d/msgid/patchmanagement/19eb971f-86c9-4a3c-821f-e95e085a6236n%40googlegroups.com", "email_text_original": "Today's Patch Tuesday roundup: In this month's update, Microsoft has addressed a\ntotal of\u00a048 vulnerabilities,\u00a0there are only two critical vulnerabilities that\nhave been fixed, no zero-day vulnerabilities or vulnerabilities with proof of\nconcept at this time.

This vulnerability is classified as a security feature\nbypass with a high severity level, carrying a CVSS score of 9.0 / 7.8. It poses\na significant risk by potentially allowing unauthorized impersonation and\nexploitation of the authentication feature. \nTo exploit this vulnerability, an unauthenticated attacker would need to\ninitiate a machine-in-the-middle (MITM) attack or employ a similar local network\nspoofing technique. By gaining control, the attacker can send a malicious\nKerberos message to the target machine, posing as the Kerberos authentication\nserver. \nAccording to the CVSS metric, the attack vector for this vulnerability is\ncategorized as \u201cadjacent\u201d (AV:A), indicating that the attacker must first gain\naccess to a restricted network to launch the attack successfully. \nMoreover, successful exploitation could result in a scope change (S:C). This\nindicates that the vulnerability\u2019s impact extends beyond the security scope\nmanaged by the authority responsible for the affected component, affecting\ncomponents managed by different security authorities. \nAs of the original publication date, there is no known exploit code available.\nThe recommended course of action is to apply the official fix as a remediation\nmeasure. \nGoogle Chrome \nGoogle has swiftly issued emergency updates in response to an actively exploited\ncritical vulnerability, marking the eighth zero-day flaw addressed in Chrome\nwithin a year. Detailed in their security advisory for CVE-2023-7024, the\ncompany acknowledges the existence of a functional exploit. \nThis high-severity issue, identified as CVE-2023-7024, stems from a heap buffer\noverflow within the WebRTC platform, a component also used in other browsers\nsuch as Mozilla Firefox, Safari, and Microsoft Edge. Researchers Cl\u00e9ment Lesigne\nand Vlad Stolyarov from Google\u2019s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) uncovered this\nflaw. The active exploitation of this vulnerability suggests potential\ninvolvement in advanced persistent threat (APT) activities or spyware campaigns. \nWhile specific details of the attacks remain undisclosed, Google\u2019s rapid\nresponse saw updates released just a day after the bug\u2019s report. These updates\nare available for Windows (versions 120.0.6099.129/130) and for Mac and Linux\n(version 120.0.6099.129). \nGoogle Web Toolkit \nThe Google Web Toolkit (GWT) Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability has been\na persistent security concern, unaddressed for over eight years, leaving\nnumerous applications exposed to server-side risks. The Google Web Toolkit, an\nopen-source tool used by around 2,000 software companies according to Enlyft,\nenables web developers to create and manage JavaScript interface applications in\nJava. \nDespite its disclosure in 2015, the critical unauthenticated Java\ndeserialization bug in the Google Web Toolkit platform remains unresolved. This\noversight suggests that significant infrastructure modifications might be\nnecessary for the future security of affected applications. \nA comprehensive study by Bishop Fox delves into the specifics of the GWT\nvulnerability. The report not only details the vulnerability but also\ndemonstrates its practical application in software and discusses possible\ncountermeasures. The researchers draw parallels between the GWT issue and the\nSpring4Shell vulnerability identified in 2022, pointing out the negligence of\ncode developers in addressing these vulnerabilities, including a lack of manual\nupdates to the framework. \nBishop Fox highlights the complexity of mitigating the risks associated with\nvulnerable web applications. Given the fundamental nature of the bug,\nsafeguarding applications developed using the framework might necessitate\nsubstantial changes either to the applications themselves or to the framework\u2019s\narchitecture. \nHowever, the study does offer some interim measures for mitigation, providing a\nstarting point for addressing this longstanding security flaw. \nMozilla Firefox \nMozilla has addressed 27 security vulnerabilities in Firefox version 121,\nenhancing the browser\u2019s security. Among these, 13 vulnerabilities, notably\ndangerous, have been identified. Eleven of these are collectively categorized\nunder CVE-2023-6864 and CVE-2023-6873. These vulnerabilities stem from\nmemory-related issues, such as buffer overflows and accessing previously freed\nmemory areas. Such flaws could potentially enable the execution of malicious\ncode when a user visits specially crafted web pages. \nAdditionally, a critical vulnerability, designated as CVE-2023-6135, concerns\nthe susceptibility of the NSS library to the \u201cMinerva\u201d attack. This specific\nattack method involves the recovery of a private key by analyzing data through\nindirect channels, posing a significant security risk. \nApache Open Office \nThe latest version of the Apache OpenOffice suite, 4.1.15, addresses four\nvulnerabilities, which were not initially mentioned in the changelog and\ndisclosed only a few days post-release. \nThe first vulnerability, CVE-2023-1183, poses a risk by allowing data to be\nwritten to any file on the system, subject to access permissions. This can occur\nwhen OBD (Office Binder Document) files, formatted in a specific way, are opened\nin OpenOffice Base. The exploit involves using the SCRIPT command in a\n\u201cdatabase/script\u201d file within the document, enabling the attacker to specify a\nfile path where the content gets written. \nAnother vulnerability, CVE-2012-5639, concerns the automatic downloading and\nopening of internal or external resources without user notification. Initially\nidentified in LibreOffice in 2012 and mistakenly marked as a non-issue, it was\nlater resolved in LibreOffice 4.2 in 2014. However, this vulnerability remained\nunaddressed in OpenOffice until now. \nCVE-2022-43680 represents a potential threat where a remote attacker could\nexecute code through specially crafted documents, particularly in low-memory\nsituations. This vulnerability stems from a use-after-free memory access error\nin the libexpat library, which is used for XML data parsing. The issue has been\nrectified in libexpat version 2.4.9. \nThe final vulnerability, CVE-2023-47804, introduces a new attack vector related\nto the previously patched CVE-2022-47502 in OpenOffice 4.1.14. It allows an\nattacker to embed a link in a document that triggers the execution of a macro\nwith arbitrary arguments. This script execution can occur upon user interaction\nwith the link or automatically through document-associated events, without\nrequiring user confirmation. \n[https://www.action1.com/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/doc-root/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Third-party-tips-website-banner.png.webp]\n[https://can01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.action1.com%2Fthird-party-patch-management-playbook-16-expert-tips%2F&data=05%7C02%7Cemail_ingestion%40bighatgroup.com%7C928e43296e8d47b3495008dc113fca78%7C5a01497e1bcb4711b6e6d24f4ab00393%7C0%7C0%7C638404212916115427%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=tGpt3hP7qKznOz7xptUlERCfGuUXiYIf64zIVtLpH3I%3D&reserved=0]\nApache OFBiz \nA critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in Apache OFBiz is\ncurrently being exploited, with publicly available Proof of Concepts (PoCs)\naiding the attacks. \nApache OFBiz, an open-source Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system, is\nwidely used by various companies for e-commerce, human resources, and accounting\nmanagement. It is a crucial part of the supply chain, impacting software like\nAtlassian\u2019s JIRA, which over 120,000 companies globally rely on. \nThis vulnerability, identified as CVE-2023-49070, was initially patched in the\nOFBiz version 18.12.10, released on December 5, 2023. The bug allows\nunauthorized privilege escalation, arbitrary code execution, and access to\nsensitive data. However, SonicWall researchers discovered that the root cause of\nCVE-2023-49070 remains unaddressed in the patched version, leaving it\nsusceptible to exploitation. \nSonicWall\u2019s report outlines methods to circumvent Apache\u2019s patch for\nCVE-2023-49070, exploiting specific credential combinations. The vulnerability\noriginates from a flaw in handling empty or special parameters. After SonicWall\ncommunicated their findings, Apache quickly addressed the issue, categorizing it\nas a Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) problem. \nThis newly identified bypass issue was assigned CVE-2023-51467 and was fixed in\nOFBiz version 18.12.11, released on December 26, 2023. Despite the availability\nof this update, many users have not yet upgraded, and the widespread\navailability of PoC exploits for pre-authenticated RCEs makes this vulnerability\nhighly appealing to attackers. The Shadowserver Foundation has observed\nextensive scanning activities using these PoCs, targeting vulnerabilities like\nCVE-2023-49070, and anticipates similar patterns for CVE-2023-51467. The primary\ntarget of these attacks is the vulnerable Confluence software. \nApache OFBiz users are strongly encouraged to update to version 18.12.11\npromptly to reduce their risk of exploitation. \nApache Struts \nShadowserver has reported the exploitation of a critical path traversal\nvulnerability in Apache Struts, identified as CVE-2023-50164. This Remote Code\nExecution (RCE) vulnerability impacts multiple versions of Struts, including\n2.0.0 \u2013 2.3.37, 2.5.0 \u2013 2.5.32, and 6.0.0 \u2013 6.3.0. Apache has issued patches for\nthis vulnerability in versions 6.3.0.2 and 2.5.33 on December 7. Successful\nexploitation of this vulnerability can lead to unauthorized server access,\nsensitive data theft, disruption of critical services, and lateral movement\nwithin compromised networks. \nAs of now, only a limited number of IP addresses have been observed engaging in\nexploitation attempts. However, a more significant wave of attacks is\nanticipated. This expectation stems from the fact that on December 10, technical\ndetails about the vulnerability were leaked, along with the release of a\npublicly available Proof of Concept (PoC) exploit. The availability of this\ninformation is likely to increase the vulnerability\u2019s exploitation by malicious\nactors. \nBarracuda ESG \nBarracuda and Mandiant have reported the active exploitation of two zero-day\nvulnerabilities by a Chinese APT group, UNC4841, with the primary vulnerability\nremaining unpatched. \nThe key vulnerability is designated as CVE-2023-7101, involving an arbitrary\ncode execution issue in the third-party library Spreadsheet::ParseExcel, a Perl\nmodule for parsing Excel files. The flaw arises from the handling of unverified\ninput data from a file by the \u2018eval\u2019 function as a string. Specifically, this\nvulnerability is linked to the processing of numeric format strings in Excel\u2019s\nparsing logic. \nThe second vulnerability, labeled CVE-2023-7102, is found in a library used in\nthe firmware of Barracuda\u2019s ESG appliances and is considered a separate bug. \nUpon successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities, UNC4841 managed to deploy\nnew variants of the SEASPY and SALTWATER malware on a limited number of ESG\nappliances. In response, Barracuda released a patch on December 22, 2023, to\naddress the compromised ESG devices showing indicators of the identified malware\nvariants. While Barracuda has restricted the functionality of the vulnerable\nlibrary in its ESG appliance, the primary issue, CVE-2023-7101, in the\nopen-source library remains unpatched. \nOrganizations utilizing the Spreadsheet::ParseExcel library are advised to\nassess the impact of CVE-2023-7101 and implement immediate remediation measures.\nExperts believe that the APT group, UNC4841, may still possess additional\nundisclosed zero-day vulnerabilities, which could be strategically employed in\ntargeted attacks against significant entities. \nApple \nThe narrative of last year\u2019s most infamous cyberattack is reaching its\nconclusion, revealing that vulnerabilities and exploits to bypass iPhone\nhardware security mechanisms were due to undocumented features in Apple chips,\nfrom A12 to A16 Bionic. The comprehensive reverse-engineering of the attack\nchain led to the patching of most firmware vulnerabilities. Many of these\nvulnerabilities were exploited due to features left in the firmware for testing,\ndebugging, or accidentally during manufacturing. \nLabelled as Operation Triangulation, this campaign is considered one of the most\nsophisticated attack chains in history. Kaspersky Lab researchers spent a year\ndissecting the attack, striving to unravel all aspects of this cyber espionage\ncampaign first discovered in early 2023. \nIn their investigation, researchers also analyzed previously known zero-days and\nunveiled a notable iOS device feature, assigned CVE-2023-38606, patched on July\n24 with iOS/iPadOS 16.6 release. Attackers exploited undocumented\nfunctionalities in Apple processors, which, while unused in iOS code, enabled\nthem to bypass hardware protections and seize complete device control.\nSpecifically, CVE-2023-38606 exploits unknown MMIO registers in Apple\u2019s A12-A16\nBionic chips, likely linked to the graphic coprocessor. This vulnerability\nallows manipulation of hardware functions and control over direct memory access.\nResearchers speculate that this undocumented feature\u2019s inclusion in iPhones was\neither an oversight or intended for Apple engineers\u2019 debugging and testing. \nYet, many questions about CVE-2023-38606 remain unanswered, including how\nattackers discovered this feature and its original intent, and whether Apple or\na third party developed it. This case underscores that systems relying on\n\u201csecurity by obscurity\u201d cannot guarantee absolute security. \nIn response to these findings, Apple has released security updates for iOS,\niPadOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS, and Safari, addressing multiple new\nvulnerabilities, including critical ones. The iOS and iPadOS updates fix 12\nvulnerabilities, with the most severe being a memory corruption issue in\nImageIO. macOS Sonoma 14.2 patches 39 bugs, including a critical Bluetooth\nvulnerability (CVE-2023-45866) allowing network-based keystroke injection. \nAdditionally, Safari 17.2 addresses two WebKit bugs leading to potential RCE and\nDoS attacks. These updates cover devices running macOS Monterey and Ventura. iOS\n17.2 and iPadOS 17.2 not only fix a Siri vulnerability but also introduce a new\ncontact key verification feature in iMessage, enhancing privacy and countering\nserver infrastructure abuse by spyware and APT vendors. \nLinux \nIn December, a local vulnerability in the Linux kernel, exploitable through\nnftables, was addressed. This vulnerability, identified as CVE-2023-6817, was\nfound in the netfilter subsystem and could allow a local user to escalate\nprivileges on the system. The issue originates from a use-after-free memory\naccess in the nf_tables module, responsible for the nftables packet filter. \nThe vulnerability is present in Linux kernel versions starting from 5.6. A\nresolution for this issue was proposed in the 6.7-rc5 testing release of the\nLinux kernel and has since been integrated into the current stable branches,\nincluding versions 5.10.204, 5.15.143, 6.1.68, and 6.6.7. \nSpecifically, the vulnerability stems from a flaw in the nft_pipapo_walk\nfunction. This function, involved in the Pile Packet Policies (PIPAPO) item\nlookup process, fails to properly check for duplicates, leading to the erroneous\nrelease of memory. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker requires access to\nnftables, achievable with CAP_NET_ADMIN privileges in any user or network\nnamespace, such as those found in isolated containers. \nFor testing purposes, a prototype exploit has been developed and released,\nallowing client systems to assess their vulnerability to this security flaw. \nESET \nA serious vulnerability in the secure traffic scanning feature of ESET\u2019s\nendpoint security products has been disclosed by an anonymous researcher. \nThis vulnerability, designated as CVE-2023-5594 and rated 7.5 on the CVSS scale,\naffects the way ESET\u2019s products monitor SSL/TLS protocol scans. Specifically, it\nleads to browsers trusting sites with certificates signed by outdated algorithms\nthat are considered untrustworthy. \nThe root cause of this issue is the improper validation of the server\ncertificate chain. ESET\u2019s system erroneously regarded an intermediate\ncertificate signed using MD5 or SHA1 as trustworthy. As a result, a browser on a\nsystem with ESET Secure Traffic Scanning enabled could erroneously trust a site\nsecured with such a certificate. \nThe range of affected products is extensive, including NOD32 Antivirus, Internet\nSecurity, Smart Security Premium, Security Ultimate, Endpoint Antivirus,\nEndpoint Security, Server Security, Mail Security, Security for Microsoft\nSharePoint Server, and File Security for Microsoft Azure. \nESET has addressed this vulnerability and is deploying patches as part of an\nautomatic update, beginning November 21. Users do not need to take any action to\ninstall this patch. \nAs per ESET\u2019s statement, there have been no observed attacks exploiting this\nvulnerability. \nIvanti \nIvanti customers are facing yet another update requirement following a series of\nrecent incidents. Adding a somewhat ironic twist, exactly thirteen new critical\nRemote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities have been identified, a number that\nmight unsettle the superstitious. \nThese vulnerabilities impact Ivanti\u2019s Avalanche mobile device management (MDM)\nsolution. As detailed by Ivanti, these security issues were identified by\nTenable researchers as part of the Zero Day Initiative. They involve the\nWLAvalancheService stack and a heap-based buffer overflow. \nAll supported versions of the product, specifically Avalanche version 6.3.1 and\nlater, are affected. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by unauthenticated\nattackers in low-complexity attacks, which do not require user interaction. Such\nattacks could lead to remote code execution or trigger a Denial of Service (DoS)\ncondition on systems that have not been patched. Additionally, Ivanti has\npatched eight other vulnerabilities ranging from moderate to high severity,\nwhich could be exploited for DoS, remote code execution, and server-side request\nforgery (SSRF). \nIvanti has addressed all discovered vulnerabilities in Avalanche v6.4.2.313.\nCustomers are strongly advised to download the Avalanche installer and upgrade\nto this latest version. \nHowever, given the sheer number of issues, there\u2019s a significant concern that\nadvanced attackers might have already exploited these vulnerabilities. This\nraises the specter of a potential new major security breach, reminiscent of the\n\u201cNorwegian\u201d case, looming on the horizon. \nOpenSSH \nResearchers at Ruhr-Universit\u00e4t Bochum have unveiled a new prefix truncation\nattack named Terrapin, compromising the integrity of OpenSSH connections under\nspecific encryption modes. \nTerrapin exploits vulnerabilities in the SSH transport layer protocol,\nleveraging cryptographic algorithms and encryption modes introduced by OpenSSH\nover a decade ago. This attack allows modification of messages in the channel,\nleading to less secure client authentication algorithms and disabling protection\nagainst keystroke timing attacks in OpenSSH 9.5. \nThe bugs related to this attack are identified as CVE-2023-48795,\nCVE-2023-46445, and CVE-2023-46446. Attackers need to be in a Man-in-the-Middle\n(MiTM) position at the network layer to intercept and manipulate the handshake\nexchange. The connection must be secured using either ChaCha20-Poly1305 or CBC\nwith encryption, then MAC. The content of messages exchanged post-handshake\ninfluences the attack\u2019s severity. \nDespite specific conditions required for Terrapin, the prevalent use of these\nencryption modes (77% as per scans) makes the attack a realistic threat. Vendors\nare progressively addressing this issue, with one solution being the\nimplementation of strict key exchange, which prevents packet injection during\nthe handshake. However, this countermeasure is only effective when implemented\non both the client and server side. \nThe research team has made available a vulnerability scanner named Terrapin on\nGitHub, enabling administrators to assess if their SSH client or server is\nsusceptible to this attack. Addressing Terrapin is not a straightforward\nsoftware update; both clients and servers require updates to safeguard against\nprefix truncation attacks. \nCurrently, the necessity for a MiTM position to execute Terrapin lessens its\nimmediate threat, which may lead to CVE-2023-48795 not being a top priority for\npatching in some instances. Detailed information on the Terrapin attack is\navailable in the technical report. \nTo remedy the Terrapin vulnerability and other issues, OpenSSH 9.6 has been\nreleased. This update addresses three security concerns: \n* * CVE-2023-48795 (the \u201cTerrapin\u201d attack): This vulnerability in the SSH\n     protocol allows a MITM attack to downgrade the connection to use less\n     secure authentication algorithms and disables protection against\n     third-party input reconstruction attacks.\n   * A vulnerability in the ssh utility: This issue allows for the substitution\n     of arbitrary shell commands by manipulating login and host values with\n     special characters. It can be exploited under certain conditions, such as\n     systems using Git submodules.\n   * A bug in ssh-agent: This issue affects the application of restrictions,\n     only applying them to the first key returned by a PKCS#11 token when adding\n     PKCS#11 private keys. This does not impact regular private keys or FIDO\n     tokens and keys set without restrictions. \nPerforce Helix Core Server \nMicrosoft has identified a critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in\nPerforce Helix Core Server, a source code management platform extensively\nutilized in the gaming, government, military, and technology sectors. Alongside\nthis, three other vulnerabilities related to Denial of Service (DoS) have been\ndetected. \nTo address these issues, Microsoft advises users to upgrade to version\n2023.1/2513900 of Perforce Helix Core Server, released on November 7, 2023. \nThe most severe of these vulnerabilities is CVE-2023-45849, which has been\nassigned a CVSS score of 10. This vulnerability poses a significant threat, as\nit could enable an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code with\nLocalSystem privileges. Such access would allow the attacker to reach local\nresources and system files, alter registry settings, and potentially cause\nfurther system compromises. \nFor enhanced protection, Microsoft recommends implementing additional security\nmeasures. These include restricting access to the Perforce Server through the\nuse of VPNs or IP whitelisting, employing TLS proxy certificates for user\nauthentication, meticulously logging all accesses to the Perforce Server, and\napplying network segmentation strategies to contain and control any potential\nbreaches. These proactive steps aim to fortify the security posture against such\nvulnerabilities. \nDell \nDell has addressed eight vulnerabilities in its PowerProtect DD solutions,\nseveral of which are rated as high severity. These vulnerabilities impact a\nrange of products, including PowerProtect Data Domain (DD) Series appliances,\nAPEX Protect Storage, PowerProtect DD Management Center, PowerProtect DP Series\nappliances, and PowerProtect Data Manager. \nThe most critical vulnerability, assigned a CVSS score of 8.8, is\nCVE-2023-44286. This is a DOM-based cross-site scripting vulnerability, which\nenables a remote, unauthorized attacker to inject malicious HTML or JavaScript\ncode into a victim\u2019s browser DOM environment. Successful exploitation of this\nvulnerability could lead to client-side request forgery, session theft, and\ninformation disclosure. \nIn addition to CVE-2023-44286, there are several other high-severity\nvulnerabilities related to operating system command injection and access control\nflaws. The command injection flaws present a risk of arbitrary command execution\non the underlying operating system with the privileges of the vulnerable\napplication, potentially allowing an attacker to take control of the target\nsystem. While exploitation typically requires local access and either low or\nelevated privileges, an attacker could potentially leverage a vulnerability like\nCVE-2023-44286 to meet authentication requirements. \nFurthermore, three moderate vulnerabilities were identified in PowerProtect\nproducts. These could be exploited by an authenticated attacker to circumvent\nsecurity restrictions and gain control of the system, obtain read and write\naccess to operating system files, and execute arbitrary SQL commands on the\napplication\u2019s server database, resulting in read access. \nDell Technologies urges customers to review the DSA-2023-412 advisory and apply\nthe necessary updates. While there has been no observed exploitation of these\nvulnerabilities, solutions from the vendor have been targeted by Lazarus APTs in\nthe past year. Hence, it\u2019s crucial for users to stay vigilant and ensure their\nsystems are up to date with the latest security patches. \n--------------------------------- \nFor a comprehensive summary updated in real-time, please\nvisit:\u00a0\u00a0https://www.action1.com/patch-tuesday-january-2024/?vmp\n[https://can01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.action1.com%2Fpatch-tuesday-january-2024%2F%3Fvmp&data=05%7C02%7Cemail_ingestion%40bighatgroup.com%7C928e43296e8d47b3495008dc113fca78%7C5a01497e1bcb4711b6e6d24f4ab00393%7C0%7C0%7C638404212916115427%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=TPTNP0PGIQKuoEionJP0Z5Vek3Go7gbxVfceiabRNOM%3D&reserved=0] \n--\nLink: https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/patchmanagement/19eb971f-86c9-4a3c-821f-e95e085a6236n%40googlegroups.com \n", "evaluated_keywords": "['eset secure traffic scanning enable could erroneously trust', 'exactly thirteen new critical remote code execution', 'update cover device run macos monterey', 'source code management platform extensively utilize', 'user visit specially craft web page', 'google web toolkit platform remain unresolved', '44286 windows kerberos security feature bypass vulnerability']", "evaluated_noun_chunks": "['this month\\'s update', 'key vulnerabilities', 'most impactful third-party applications', 'comprehensive summary', 'Windows Kerberos Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability', 'Google Chrome', 'Mozilla Firefox']", "post_type": "Helpful tool", "unique_tokens": 1174, "product_build_ids": [], "cve_ids": null, "etl_processing_status": {"document_processed": true, "entities_extracted": true, "graph_prepared": true, "vector_prepared": true, "last_processed_at": "2025-01-02T12:19:47.295929", "processing_version": "1.0"}, "is_processed": true, "next_id": null, "previous_id": "1f418ca7-f775-9ff1-c8b0-90ed4a934241", "product_mentions": [], "thread_id": "patch_tuesday_roundup_action1", "noun_chunks": "['this month\\'s update', 'key vulnerabilities', 'most impactful third-party applications', 'comprehensive summary', 'Windows Kerberos Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability', 'Google Chrome', 'Mozilla Firefox']", "keywords": "['eset secure traffic scanning enable could erroneously trust', 'exactly thirteen new critical remote code execution', 'update cover device run macos monterey', 'source code management platform extensively utilize', 'user visit specially craft web page', 'google web toolkit platform remain unresolved', '44286 windows kerberos security feature bypass vulnerability']", "node_label": "PatchManagementPost", "kb_ids": [], "build_numbers": []}, "added_at": "2025-01-01T23:20:05.482574", "last_updated": "2025-01-02T18:46:02.264387"}
