{"symptom_label": "TeamsUninstallsAfterUpgradeLogOffInconsistency", "description": "Following a Teams upgrade, users may experience an issue where Microsoft Teams uninstalls itself upon logging off and back on. This behavior results from the creation of an unintended uninstall registry entry within several key registry locations such as HKCU\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Run and HKLM\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Run. Such inconsistencies can disrupt productivity and necessitate additional troubleshooting efforts to ensure continuity of service for Teams users.", "source_id": "c8193f20-8218-dfbe-6e7b-de351d840a56", "source_type": "PatchManagementPost", "tags": ["Microsoft Teams", "Upgrade Issue", "Registry Problem"], "node_id": "ea439bb8-5dcd-4768-8df1-aaa065a4f142", "metadata": {"node_label": "Symptom", "reliability": 0.8, "severity_type": "Moderate", "entity_type": "Symptom"}, "added_at": "2025-01-01T17:16:03.242682", "last_updated": "2025-01-01T17:16:03.242682"}
