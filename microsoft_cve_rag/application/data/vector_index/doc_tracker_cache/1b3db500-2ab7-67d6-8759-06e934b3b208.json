This\nbatch includes three zero-day fixes and three vulnerabilities for which proofs\nof concept exist. It encompasses three critical fixes, a significant reduction\nfrom last month. Here are details on the most interesting critical updates. \nWindows Cloud Files Mini Filter Driver Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability \nThe CVE-2023-36036 vulnerability, identified today, is a critical zero-day\nelevation of privilege issue affecting Microsoft Windows 10 and later, as well\nas Microsoft Windows Server 2008 and onwards. With a CVSS score of 7.8, it is\nconsidered a significant threat according to Microsoft\u2019s assessment criteria.\nThe vulnerability, which requires local access, is of low complexity and can be\nexploited without high-level privileges or user interaction. Successful\nexploitation allows attackers to gain SYSTEM-level privileges, making it an\nideal tool for escalating privileges after initial access, such as through\nphishing. \nMicrosoft urgently recommends updating systems to address this vulnerability,\nwhich is already being exploited in active attacks, although no proof of concept\nis currently available. \nWindows DWM Core Library Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability \nCVE-2023-36033 is a zero-day vulnerability targeting the Windows DWM Core\nLibrary, presenting an elevation of privilege risk. It shares traits with\nCVE-2023-36036, notably a CVSS score of 7.8. This vulnerability can be exploited\nlocally, with low complexity and without needing high-level privileges or user\ninteraction. Attackers exploiting this flaw could gain SYSTEM privileges, making\nit an efficient method for escalating privileges, especially after initial\naccess through methods like phishing. It affects Microsoft Windows 10 and later,\nas well as Microsoft Windows Server 2019 and subsequent versions. \nUnlike the previous vulnerability, there is a proof of concept available for\nCVE-2023-36033, and Microsoft has confirmed its active exploitation. Therefore,\nMicrosoft urgently advises applying the available updates to mitigate this\nvulnerability. \nWindows SmartScreen Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability \nCVE-2023-36025 is a zero-day vulnerability in the Windows SmartScreen feature,\nposing a significant security bypass risk. Unlike the other vulnerabilities\nmentioned, this one has a network attack vector and requires user interaction,\nthough it still maintains low attack complexity and doesn\u2019t require high\nprivileges. Notably, it has a high CVSS rating of 8.8. \nThis vulnerability impacts Microsoft Windows 10 and later versions, as well as\nMicrosoft Windows Server 2008 and subsequent releases. It enables attackers to\ncircumvent Windows Defender SmartScreen checks and prompts. To exploit this\nflaw, a user must interact with a malicious Internet shortcut (.URL) or a\nhyperlink directing to such a shortcut. This exploitation allows attackers to\nprevent Windows Smart Screen from blocking malware. \nMicrosoft has confirmed that this vulnerability is currently being exploited in\nactive attacks, although no proof of concept is available as of now. Given its\nhigh CVSS rating and the fact that it is being actively exploited, this makes\nCVE-2023-36025 one of the vulnerabilities that should be prioritized for\npatching. \nMicrosoft Exchange \nMicrosoft has chosen to overlook four vulnerabilities in its Exchange mail\nserver, identified by Peter Bazydlo of the Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative\n(ZDI). These vulnerabilities, comprising three Server-Side Request Forgery\n(SSRF) issues and one Remote Code Execution (RCE), are currently tracked as\nZDI-23-1578, ZDI-23-1579, ZDI-23-1580, and ZDI-23-1581, pending the assignment\nof CVE identifiers. \nZDI reported these vulnerabilities to Microsoft on September 7-8. Microsoft\nacknowledged them on September 11 but later, between September 27-29, indicated\nthat these vulnerabilities do not necessitate \u201cimmediate maintenance.\u201d \nContrary to their initial classification as zero-day vulnerabilities in the\ndisclosure to ZDI, Microsoft does not categorize them as such. The rationale is\nthat they have not been exploited in the wild, nor is there any publicly\navailable proof-of-concept. Additionally, exploiting these vulnerabilities\nrequires authentication, which diminishes the likelihood of their malicious use.\nNotably, one of these vulnerabilities, ZDI-23-1578, which involves a data\ndeserialization issue leading to remote code execution, was already addressed in\nthe August Patch Tuesday update. \nMicrosoft has emphasized that exploiting each of these security issues\nnecessitates prior access to email credentials. The company also stated that for\ntwo of these vulnerabilities, there is no evidence suggesting they could be used\nfor privilege escalation or to access sensitive customer data. \nMicrosoft Access \nResearchers at Check Point Research have identified a security vulnerability in\nMicrosoft Access that could potentially allow an attacker to acquire a Windows\nuser\u2019s NTLM token. This vulnerability can be exploited via any TCP port,\nincluding port 80, when a user opens an .accdb or .mdb file. This method\neffectively circumvents existing firewall rules that are meant to prevent the\ntheft of NTLM credentials. \nNTLM, an outdated authentication protocol introduced by Microsoft in 1993, is\nsusceptible to three well-known types of attacks: brute force, pass-the-hash,\nand relay attacks. The vulnerability leverages a feature in Microsoft Access\nknown as \u201cLinked Tables,\u201d which enables Access databases to link to tables in\nother databases. Check Point notes that this feature is not covered by local\nfirewall rules, thereby allowing attackers to exploit it to transmit NTLM hashes\nacross the network. \nFurthermore, the Check Point specialists have also described a method to bypass\nprotections that block all outbound traffic on ports typically used by the NTLM\nprotocol (139 and 445). This bypass exploits the \u201cAccess Link Tables\u201d feature in\nthe Microsoft Access application. \nMicrosoft 365 \nZscaler\u2019s ThreatLabz team has identified an alarming number of\nvulnerabilities\u2014117 in total\u2014in Microsoft 365 applications for both Windows and\nMac. This surge in security flaws stems from the integration of the SketchUp 3D\nlibrary. Microsoft introduced support for SketchUp files (SKP) in June 2022,\ninadvertently introducing numerous bugs into Microsoft 365. These\nvulnerabilities were uncovered through three months of thorough research by the\nThreatLabz team. Initially, only four SKP-related bugs were identified in\nMicrosoft Office as part of the Zero Day Initiative by the end of December 2022.\nThis discovery prompted the ThreatLabz researchers to examine the problematic\ncomponent more closely. \nMicrosoft has responded by assigning identifiers CVE-2023-28285, CVE-2023-29344,\nand CVE-2023-33146 to track these vulnerabilities. Although a patch was released\nby Microsoft to address these issues, ThreatLabz successfully found ways to\nbypass it. \nIn response to these findings, Microsoft took preventive steps in June 2023 by\ntemporarily disabling SketchUp support in Microsoft 365. The researchers have\ncomprehensively detailed their detection methods and the technical aspects of\nsome of these vulnerabilities in a report. The first part of this report has\nbeen published, with the second part expected to be available shortly. \nGoogle Chrome \nIn its latest version 119, the Google Chrome browser has addressed 15 security\nvulnerabilities. These include three high-criticality, eight medium-criticality,\nand two low-criticality vulnerabilities. Among the most critical are\nCVE-2023-5480, which relates to implementation errors in the payment system, and\nCVE-2023-5482, involving incorrect data validation in USB functionalities. \nMany of these vulnerabilities were detected through automated testing using\ntools like AddressSanitizer, MemorySanitizer, Control Flow Integrity, LibFuzzer,\nand AFL. \nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that these vulnerabilities do not compromise all\nlayers of the browser\u2019s protection. They are unable to allow code execution on\nthe system outside of Chrome\u2019s sandbox environment. As part of its security\nbounty program for this release, Google has awarded a total of $40.5K across 13\ndifferent bounties. \nMozilla Firefox \nMozilla\u2019s latest release, Firefox 119, not only brings new features and bug\nfixes but also includes 25 security updates. Of these, 17 vulnerabilities,\nprimarily grouped under CVE-2023-5730 and CVE-2023-5731, are classified as\ndangerous due to memory-related issues. These include buffer overflows and\naccessing previously freed memory areas, which could potentially enable an\nattacker to execute code when specific, specially crafted web pages are\naccessed. \nAdditionally, a separate critical vulnerability, identified as CVE-2023-5721,\nposes a risk by allowing clickjacking. This vulnerability could be exploited to\nmanipulate users into inadvertently confirming or canceling certain browser\ndialogues or warnings. \nVeeam ONE \nVeeam has recently issued patches for four vulnerabilities in its Veeam ONE\nmonitoring and analysis platform, including two critical Remote Code Execution\n(RCE) vulnerabilities with high CVSS base scores of 9.8 and 9.9 out of 10. \nThe first critical vulnerability, CVE-2023-38547, could allow an unauthenticated\nuser to access information about the SQL Server connection used by Veeam ONE for\nits configuration database. The second, CVE-2023-38548, enables an\nunauthenticated user with access to the Veeam ONE web client to obtain an\naccount\u2019s NTLM hash. \nAdditionally, Veeam has rectified a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability,\nidentified as CVE-2023-38549. This flaw could be exploited to acquire an\nadministrator access token and requires communication to be effective. \nThe fourth vulnerability addressed, CVE-2023-41723, could be exploited by an\nattacker with read-only user privileges to access dashboard schedules. However,\nthis vulnerability does not allow the attacker to make any changes. \nThese vulnerabilities impact all actively supported versions of Veeam ONE up to\nthe latest version. The fixes are included in Veeam ONE 12 P20230314 (version\n12.0.1.2591), Veeam ONE 11a (version 11.0.1.1880), and Veeam ONE 11 (version\n11.0.0.1379). \nApache ActiveMQ \nApache ActiveMQ\nA critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability has been identified in over\n3,000 publicly accessible Apache ActiveMQ servers. Apache ActiveMQ, known for\nits scalability, is an open-source message broker that supports Java and various\ncross-language clients, along with multiple protocols like AMQP, MQTT, OpenWire,\nand STOMP. It\u2019s widely used in enterprise environments for system communication\nwithout direct connectivity, thanks to its range of secure authentication and\nauthorization mechanisms. \nThe vulnerability, designated as CVE-2023-46604, is rated 10.0 on the CVSS v3\nscale. It allows attackers to execute arbitrary shell commands by utilizing\nserialized class types in the OpenWire protocol. \nAs per Apache\u2019s advisory on October 27, the issue impacts Apache Active MQ and\nthe legacy OpenWire module versions from 5.18.x through 5.18.3, 5.17.x through\n5.17.6, 5.16.x through 5.16.7, down to version 5.15.16. Fixes were released on\nthe same day for versions 5.15.16, 5.16.7, 5.17.6, and 5.18.3. \nResearchers from ArcticWolf and Huntress Labs discovered attacks exploiting\nCVE-2023-46604 to deploy SparkRAT malware on ActiveMQ servers starting as early\nas October 10, well before Apache released the patch on October 25. \nFurthermore, even after the patch release, over 9,200 Apache ActiveMQ servers\nremained open on the network, with more than 4,770 still vulnerable to exploits\ntargeting CVE-2023-46604. Following this, ransomware attacks were observed, with\nsome of the compromised servers being encrypted by HelloKitty, followed by\nTellYouThePass, as noted by researchers from Huntress Labs and Rapid7. \nGiven Apache ActiveMQ\u2019s critical role as a message broker in enterprise\nenvironments, the exploitation of CVE-2023-46604 poses severe risks, including\npotential lateral movement across the network. With the technical details of\nexploiting CVE-2023-46604 publicly available, it is imperative and urgent for\nsecurity updates to be applied. \nAtlassian \nOn October 17th, Atlassian issued a security bulletin announcing patches for 28\nvulnerabilities in their software, including two critical and 26 high-risk\nissues. \nThe most severe vulnerabilities are CVE-2023-22515, with a maximum severity\nscore of 10.0, affecting all Confluence Data Center and Server versions, and\nCVE-2019-13990, scoring 9.8, impacting Jira Service Management Data Center and\nServer. The majority of the other significant vulnerabilities have a 7.5 rating,\nexcept for CVE-2023-22514 at 7.8 and CVE-2021-22569 at 5.5. \nA Proof of Concept (PoC) for CVE-2023-22515, a zero-day vulnerability in\nAtlassian Confluence, was incorporated into Metasploit after several operational\nexploit versions were leaked. Notably, this vulnerability was actively exploited\nby an attacker, known as DarkShadow or Oro0lxy, starting September 14, 2023,\nprior to its official disclosure on October 4. \nAnother grave concern is CVE-2023-22518, a critical vulnerability in Confluence\nthat could lead to substantial data loss due to improper authorization. This\nflaw affects all versions of Confluence Data Center and Server, though it does\nnot threaten data privacy. Atlassian has addressed this in specific Confluence\nversions. If upgrading isn\u2019t possible, implementing mitigating measures such as\nbackups and restricting Internet access is recommended. \nThe release of a publicly accessible PoC for CVE-2023-22518 has triggered active\nexploitation of this vulnerability. Security firms GreyNoise and Rapid7 have\nobserved extensive campaigns exploiting CVE-2023-22518 and the older critical\nbug CVE-2023-22515. These attacks have often involved deploying the Cerber\nransomware on compromised servers. \nThis event marks the second significant instance of CerberImposter ransomware\nbeing used in attacks, following a previous campaign against Atlassian\nConfluence that exploited the RCE vulnerability CVE-2021-26084 two years\nearlier. \nKubernetes ingress-nginx \nThree high-severity vulnerabilities, currently unpatched, have been identified\nin the NGINX controller for Kubernetes. These vulnerabilities could potentially\nallow an attacker to access sensitive credentials within a Kubernetes cluster. \nThe ingress controller in Kubernetes serves as a gateway, managing external\nnetwork access to services within the cluster. The widely-used ingress-nginx\ncontroller, distinct from the Kubernetes basic ingress controllers for AWS, GCE,\nand nginx, leverages the NGINX server for forwarding access, routing external\nrequests, and load balancing. Notably, the ingress-nginx controller is\nmaintained separately by F5/NGINX and is not affiliated with the Kubernetes\nproject\u2019s nginx controller. \nThe vulnerabilities are as follows: \n* * CVE-2022-4886 (CVSS score: 8.8): This vulnerability allows bypassing path\n sanitization in Ingress-nginx, enabling access to Ingress-nginx controller\n credentials.\n * CVE-2023-5043 (CVSS score: 7.6): This allows the injection of an\n Ingress-nginx annotation to execute arbitrary commands.\n * CVE-2023-5044 (CVSS score: 7.6): This involves code injection through the\n nginx.ingress.kubernetes[.io]/permanent-redirect annotation. \nCVE-2022-4886 specifically involves inadequate validation in the\n\u201cspec.rules[].http.paths[].path\u201d field of the Ingress object. An attacker with\naccess to Ingress could exploit this to download Kubernetes API credentials from\nthe ingress controller. The vulnerability arises because the application does\nnot sufficiently verify the validity of internal paths, which could be\nmanipulated to point to internal files containing service account tokens for\nauthenticating to the API server. \nIn the absence of an official patch, software developers have suggested\nmitigations. These include enabling the strict-validate-path-type option and\nusing the \u2013enable-annotation-validation flag. These measures are designed to\nprevent the creation of Ingress objects with invalid characters and enforce\nadditional restrictions. ARMO recommends updating NGINX to version 1.19 and\nadding the \u2013enable-annotation-validation command line configuration to resolve\nCVE-2023-5043 and CVE-2023-5044. \nCisco \nCisco is cautioning customers about a new zero-day vulnerability in IOS XE,\nidentified as CVE-2023-20198, that could potentially compromise devices. This\ncritical issue, a privilege escalation vulnerability, affects the default\nimage\u2019s IOS XE web user interface. The vulnerability, exploitable from the\nnetwork or directly from the Internet, allows an unauthenticated remote attacker\nto create a high-privilege account (level 15 access) and gain full control of\nthe device. Such access enables an attacker to alter network routing rules, open\nports to connect to attacker-controlled servers, and steal data. \nCisco Talos detected malicious activity related to CVE-2023-20198 on September\n28, following unusual activity on a customer\u2019s device. Analysis revealed the\ncreation of a new user account named \u201ccisco_tac_admin\u201d as early as September 18.\nThis activity paused on October 1 but resumed on October 12, believed to be by\nthe same attacker. In September, the hackers merely created a new account, but\nin October, they also deployed an implant consisting of a configuration file,\nenabling them to execute arbitrary commands at the system or IOS level. \nThe implant was delivered by exploiting CVE-2021-1435, a command injection\nvulnerability in IOS XE that Cisco had patched in March 2021. However, the\nimplant was also observed on devices patched for CVE-2021-1435, with the\ndelivery mechanism in these cases remaining unidentified. The implant is not\npermanent, disappearing after a device reboot, but the attacker-created accounts\nremain active. \nResearchers have documented extensive zero-day attacks on the Cisco IOS XE\noperating system. VulnCheck discovered thousands of compromised Cisco IOS XE\nsystems with the web user interface feature enabled and released a scanner for\nmalicious implants, while LeakIX reported more than 30,000 such systems. Over\n34,500 Cisco IOS XE devices have been compromised by CVE-2023-20198 attacks,\naccording to Orange\u2019s CERT Coordination Center. Shodan\u2019s data indicates that\nover 140,000 web-enabled Cisco devices are currently online. \nGreyNoise has identified nearly 42,000 Cisco routers and switches worldwide with\na malicious implant installed. The scope of the Cisco IOS XE zero-day impact has\nwidened with the discovery of a similar vulnerability, CVE-2023-20273. Rockwell\nAutomation informed customers about an actively exploited zero-day affecting\nStratix industrial switches. Unknown attackers exploited two zero-day\nvulnerabilities in Cisco IOS XE (CVE-2023-20198 and CVE-2023-20273) to create\nhigh-privilege accounts and deploy a Lua implant for full system control. The\nRockwell advisory, issued before the second zero-day discovery, does not mention\nCVE-2023-20273, but this vulnerability also impacts IOS XE software on Rockwell\nswitches. \nA publicly available exploit for the critical Cisco IOS XE vulnerability\n(CVE-2023-20198) emerged from a trap study by SECUINFRA. Horizon3.ai researchers\ndetailed how attackers can bypass authentication on vulnerable Cisco IOS XE\ndevices. They can encode an HTTP request to the WMSA service in iosd, a key\nbinary in Cisco IOS XE, to generate a configuration file for OpenResty (a\nNginx-based server with Lua scripting) used by the vulnerable webui service.\nWSMA enables command execution via SOAP requests, including access to a\nconfiguration function to create a fully privileged user. The researchers\ndemonstrated how the bug could be exploited to create a new user with level 15\nprivileges, granting full device control and the ability to write malicious\nimplants directly to the hard drive. \nLeakIX researchers confirmed the exploit\u2019s effectiveness, detecting specific\ncommand executions on their Cisco IOS XE decoys. Consequently, Cisco updated its\nadvisory for CVE-2023-20198, announcing IOS XE updates containing fixes for the\nvulnerability. Despite Cisco releasing patches for most IOS XE software\nversions, thousands of systems remain vulnerable. \nCisco also released software updates addressing 27 vulnerabilities across its\nAdaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Management Center (FMC), and\nFirepower Threat Defense (FTD) products, and issued 22 security advisories. The\nmost severe is CVE-2023-20048, with a CVSS rating of 9.9, caused by insufficient\nauthorization of configuration commands in the FMC web service interface. An\nattacker could exploit this using crafted HTTP requests to execute configuration\ncommands on the targeted FTD device. \nSeven advisories describe eight flaws in ASA, FMC, and FTD software, with five\npotentially leading to Denial of Service (DoS) and the rest permitting command\ninjection. The DoS vulnerabilities impact ICMPv6 processing, VPNs, internal\npacket processing, and ICMPv6 inspection using Snort 2 features and APIs in\nthese products. \nEighteen moderate vulnerabilities in ASA, FMC, and FTD could result in DoS,\narbitrary file uploads, SAML hijacking, XSS attacks, policy bypass, discovery\nmechanism bypass, certificate authentication bypass, and geolocation filter\nbypass. The most severe, CVE-2022-20713, exploitable remotely without\nauthentication, manipulates client requests in the VPN services component of ASA\nand FTD software. \nThe issue was discovered on August 10, 2022, and it took over a year for Cisco\nto provide a patch. Despite the public availability of the PoC exploit, there\nhave been no reported real-world exploits. \nUsers with publicly accessible Cisco devices are advised to update them as soon\nas possible or restrict their internet access to mitigate these vulnerabilities. \nCitrix \nMandiant has issued a warning about the use of a recently patched zero-day\nvulnerability in Citrix NetScaler Application Delivery Controller (ADC) and\nNetScaler Gateway, identified as CVE-2023-4966, in attacks observed since\nAugust. This vulnerability, with a CVSS rating of 9.4, allows unauthorized\naccess to steal sensitive information from devices set up as a gateway or AAA\nvirtual server. Citrix released fixes for the NetScaler ADC and Gateway on\nOctober 10, initially not highlighting the exploit potential. However, they\nsubsequently updated their advisory to alert customers about the exploitation of\nCVE-2023-4966 and urged immediate updating of their systems. \nThe resolved versions of the bug include NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway\nversions 14.1-8.50, 13.1-49.15, and 13.0-92.19, as well as specific FIPS and\nNDcPP versions. Mandiant noted that the vulnerability has been exploited in\nattacks targeting the government sector and technology companies since August.\nAttackers successfully exploiting this vulnerability could hijack authenticated\nsessions, circumventing multi-factor authentication. These sessions might\npersist even after the CVE-2023-4966 fix is applied. Researchers also observed\ninstances where data was stolen before patching and later used by attackers. \nSession hijacking of this nature can give attackers wider access, enabling them\nto collect credentials, move laterally within networks, and access further\nresources in compromised environments. Mandiant\u2019s remediation guide advises\nisolating NetScaler ADC and gateway instances before patching, restricting\naccess to unpatched devices, updating devices, terminating all active sessions\npost-update, and scanning for malicious activity. They also recommend restoring\ninfected devices from clean backups, changing credentials if remote access is\nenabled with single-factor authentication, and limiting inbound access to\ntrusted or pre-defined IP address ranges. \nAdditionally, a Proof of Concept (PoC) for the Citrix Bleed vulnerability\n(CVE-2023-4966) has been released. Assetnote researchers have elaborated on the\nexploitation of CVE-2023-4966 and published a PoC exploit on GitHub to\ndemonstrate their findings and assist in verifying the vulnerability. With the\nCVE-2023-4966 exploit now public, an increase in attacks against Citrix\nNetscaler appliances is expected for initial access to corporate networks. This\nprediction was confirmed by Shadowserver, which reported a surge in exploitation\nattempts after the PoC advisory\u2019s release. Due to the typical use of such\nvulnerabilities in ransomware and data theft attacks, system administrators are\nstrongly urged to promptly install the necessary patches. \nVMware \nVMware has issued a warning about an authentication bypass vulnerability in\nvRealize Log Insight (VMware Aria Operations for Logs), identified as\nCVE-2023-34051. This vulnerability, for which a PoC is available, enables an\nunauthenticated attacker to execute code remotely with root privileges under\nspecific conditions. \nThe Horizon3 researchers, who discovered the bug, noted that successful\nexploitation relies on permissions to add an interface or static IP address.\nHorizon3\u2019s technical analysis of the vulnerability\u2019s root cause provides insight\ninto how CVE-2023-34051 can be exploited for Remote Code Execution (RCE) with\nroot privileges on unpatched VMware devices. They have also published a PoC\nexploit and a list of Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) to detect hacking\nattempts. The exploit leverages IP address spoofing and Thrift RPC endpoints to\nwrite arbitrary files, typically creating a reverse shell via a cron job, though\nthe payload file requires modification to suit the environment. The attacker\nmust share the same IP address as the master/work node for the attack to\nsucceed. This vulnerability effectively serves as a workaround for a series of\ncritical bugs fixed by VMware in January, which also allow RCE. \nThese include CVE-2022-31706 (a directory traversal bug), CVE-2022-31704 (an\naccess control violation), and CVE-2022-31711 (an information disclosure bug),\ncollectively known as VMSA-2023-0001. Attackers could exploit these to inject\nmalicious files into devices running unpatched Aria Operations for Logs\nsoftware. Following the patch for VMSA-2023-0001, Horizon3 released a PoC that\nexploits Thrift RPC endpoints for arbitrary file writes. \nThe vulnerability is relatively easy to exploit but requires attackers to have\nspecific infrastructure configurations to serve the malicious payload. As the\nproduct is unlikely to be exposed on the Internet, attackers need initial\nnetwork access, making vulnerable VMware appliances valuable targets for lateral\nmovement within compromised networks. \nVMware has also patched a critical RCE vulnerability in vCenter Server,\ndesignated as CVE-2023-34048 with a CVSS rating of 9.8, discovered by Grigory\nDorodnov from the Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative. It involves an out-of-range\nwrite vulnerability in the DCE/RPC protocol implementation, exploitable by an\nattacker with network access to vCenter Server, potentially leading to RCE. \nThe updates for this vulnerability are available in VMware vCenter Server 8.0\n(8.0U1d or 8.0U2), VMware vCenter Server 7.0 (7.0U3o), VMware Cloud Foundation\n5.x, and 4.x. Additionally, VMware issued a patch for vCenter Server versions\n6.7U3, 6.5U3, and VCF 3.x. The latest update also addresses CVE-2023-34056, a\npartial information disclosure vulnerability in vCenter. \nWhile there are no known real-world exploitations of these vulnerabilities,\nVMware strongly advises customers to promptly apply patches to mitigate\npotential threats. \nCisco \nCisco has recently unveiled a series of patches aimed at addressing various\nvulnerabilities, among them a moderately severe vulnerability found in IOS and\nIOS XE software that has exhibited signs of exploitation. \nDesignated as CVE-2023-20109, this vulnerability pertains to the Group Encrypted\nTransport VPN (GET VPN) feature within IOS and IOS XE and carries the potential\nfor Remote Code Execution (RCE). To successfully exploit this vulnerability, an\nattacker necessitates valid credentials and administrative control over a group\nmember or key server. The root issue stems from inadequate attribute validation\nwithin the Group Domain of Interpretation (GDOI) and G-IKEv2 protocols utilized\nin the GET VPN function. \nThis vulnerability affects all Cisco products operating on vulnerable versions\nof IOS or IOS XE with the GDOI or G-IKEv2 protocol enabled. Unfortunately, there\nexists no viable workaround for this vulnerability, thus prompting Cisco to\nstrongly recommend that customers apply updates. This is especially crucial\nconsidering documented attempts to exploit this vulnerability uncovered in an\ninternal investigation. \nAdditionally, Cisco has rolled out patches for various vulnerabilities in the\nCatalyst SD-WAN Manager product, including a critical vulnerability\n(CVE-2023-20252) within the SAML APIs. This vulnerability carries a CVSS rating\nof 9.8 and could potentially enable an unauthenticated attacker to gain\nunauthorized access to the application on behalf of an arbitrary user. This\nvulnerability was addressed alongside four other high-severity issues, each\nposing unique threats, such as bypassing authorization and rollback of\ncontroller configurations, accessing the Elasticsearch system database, reaching\nanother tenant managed on the same instance, or causing a Denial of Service\n(DoS) situation. \nCisco has also taken measures to rectify other significant issues, spanning RCE,\nDoS, unauthorized data access, and file theft, through software updates for IOS,\nIOS XE, and Cisco DNA Center. Additionally, the company has addressed several\nmoderately severe issues impacting its products. \nIt\u2019s noteworthy that, aside from CVE-2023-20109, Cisco currently possesses no\nknowledge of these vulnerabilities being actively exploited in any attacks. \nSolarWinds \nSolarWinds has remediated critical vulnerabilities in its Access Rights Manager\n(ARM) software, which is designed for managing user access rights in IT\nenvironments. This includes integration with Microsoft Active Directory,\nrole-based access management, and visual feedback, among other features. \nOn June 22, researchers participating in the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI)\nidentified eight bugs in SolarWinds ARM, three of which were classified as\ncritical. These include: \n* * CVE-2023-35182 (rated 9.8): This vulnerability allows unauthenticated\n remote attackers to execute arbitrary code with system-level privileges. It\n stems from untrusted data deserialization in the\n createGlobalServerChannelInternal method.\n * CVE-2023-35185 (rated 9.8): This issue permits unauthenticated remote\n attackers to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM-level privileges. The\n vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-entered paths in\n the OpenFile method.\n * CVE-2023-35187 (rated 9.8): Similar to the others, this vulnerability\n enables unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary code with\n SYSTEM-level privileges. This is possible because of inadequate validation\n of user-supplied paths in the OpenClientUpdateFile method. \nIn addition to these critical vulnerabilities, SolarWinds also patched several\nother issues rated as high severity, which could potentially be exploited to\ngain elevated privileges or remote code execution on a host following\nauthentication. To mitigate these vulnerabilities, SolarWinds released a patch\nin version 2023.2.1 of its Access Rights Manager. The company also issued\nadvisories detailing all eight vulnerabilities, including their severity as\nassessed by SolarWinds. Notably, the company itself did not categorize any of\nthe vulnerabilities as critical but assigned the highest rating of 8.8 for those\nconsidered high severity. \nOracle \nOracle has rolled out a scheduled Critical Patch Update for its range of\nproducts, addressing a significant number of security vulnerabilities. In total,\nthe update rectifies 387 security issues across various Oracle products. Key\nvulnerabilities addressed in this update include: \n* Java SE and GraalVM for JDK: This update fixes three vulnerabilities in Java\n SE and four in GraalVM for JDK. All these vulnerabilities are capable of\n being remotely exploited without authentication in environments that permit\n the execution of untrusted code. In Java SE, the most severe vulnerabilities,\n located in CORBA and JSSE, have a threat level of 5.3. GraalVM\u2019s most\n critical vulnerability, found in Node.js, carries a threat level of 7.5.\n These issues have been resolved in Java SE versions 21.0.1 and 17.0.9.\n * MySQL Server: Of the 26 vulnerabilities patched in MySQL Server, two are\n capable of remote exploitation. The most significant vulnerabilities,\n impacting the Curl package, the OpenSSL library, and the optimizer, have\n severity ratings of 7.5 and 6.5. Lesser issues affect the optimizer, InnoDB,\n DDL, UDF, and encryption tools. These vulnerabilities will be fixed in\n upcoming MySQL Community Server releases 8.2.0, 8.0.35, and 5.7.44.\n * VirtualBox: Three vulnerabilities in VirtualBox, with threat levels of 7.9\n and 7.3, have been addressed. These vulnerabilities are fixed in the\n VirtualBox 7.0.12 update, with branch 6.1 not being affected by these issues.\n * Solaris: Two vulnerabilities in Solaris, impacting the kernel and file\n system, have been identified and addressed, with threat levels of 5.5 and\n 3.1. These issues are resolved in the Solaris 11.4 SRU62 update. The update\n also includes enhancements and fixes to several packages, including python\n 3.7.17, rabbitmq 3.8.35, Firefox 102.15.0esr, Thunderbird 102.15.0, pcre2\n 10.42, unrar 6.2.10, PHP 8.2.10, Tomcat 8.5.93, mod_jk 1.2.49, cups, perl,\n ucups, and zfs. \nGiven the critical nature of these vulnerabilities, it is highly recommended for\nusers of Oracle products to apply these updates promptly to mitigate potential\nsecurity risks. \nExim \nThe development team of the Exim mail server has issued a security update\naddressing the final three out of six zero-day vulnerabilities that were\ndisclosed as part of the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI). The three most critical\nvulnerabilities among these were initially patched in early October. \nWith this latest update, all six vulnerabilities originally identified by\nresearchers in the ZDI have now been remediated. Additionally, Exim has\nannounced the deprecation of all previous versions of the Exim server. As a\nresult, only the current version, 4.96.2, is officially supported going forward.\nThis decision underscores the importance of updating to the latest version for\nenhanced security and support. \nSysAid \nCl0p ransomware operators have launched a significant new campaign targeting\ncustomers of SysAid, an IT management software provider. SysAid is alerting its\ncustomers about a critical vulnerability, CVE-2023-47246, which is being\nactively exploited by ransomware groups. \nThe zero-day exploit was initially detected by Microsoft\u2019s threat analysis team,\nwho promptly informed SysAid about the ongoing attacks. SysAid confirmed that\nits on-premises software was impacted by this vulnerability, characterized as a\npath traversal issue that leads to Remote Code Execution (RCE). SysAid became\naware of the zero-day on November 2. By November 8, they announced the release\nof version 23.3.36, specifically designed to address this vulnerability.\nAlongside this fix, SysAid has also provided details about the attacks they\nobserved, along with Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) and advisories. \nMicrosoft has linked CVE-2023-47246 to the activities of Lace Tempest (also\nknown as DEV-0950), a threat actor whose operations are associated with the\nFIN11 and TA505 groups, both known for using Cl0p ransomware. Microsoft had\npreviously connected this operator to the widespread exploitation of the MOVEit\nTransfer zero-day, which affected over 2,500 organizations. In the recent\nattacks on SysAid, the hackers leveraged IT support software to deploy MeshAgent\nand GraceWire, typically followed by lateral movement within networks, data\ntheft, and ransomware deployment. SysAid also noted that the attackers used a\nPowerShell script to erase traces and evidence from the targeted servers. \nCVSS 4.0 \nOver eight years after the release of CVSS v3.0 and eighteen years since the\ndebut of its first version in February 2005, FIRST (Forum of Incident Response\nand Security Teams) has launched the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)\n4.0. This update, involving more than 650 organizations from over 100 countries,\nwas initially introduced at the 35th Annual Conference in Montreal in June,\nrepresenting a significant evolution for the cyber sector. \nCVSS 4.0 aims to address previous ambiguities in severity ratings of\nvulnerabilities. It enhances the standard by offering more detailed baseline\ngranularity for users, clarifying the assessment of different levels, and\nimproving the evaluation of environment-specific security requirements and\ncompensating controls. \nThis latest version of CVSS introduces additional metrics for vulnerability\nassessment, such as security (S), automation (A), recovery (R), value density\n(V), response effort (RE), and vendor urgency (U). A notable improvement in CVSS\nv4.0 is its expanded applicability to Operational Technology (OT), Industrial\nControl Systems (ICS), and the Internet of Things (IoT), with added security\nmetrics and values in both the additional and environmental metrics groups. \nThe CVSS standard is designed to identify essential characteristics of security\nvulnerabilities and generate a numerical rating reflecting their technical\nseverity, offering information and guidance. FIRST emphasizes that CVSS is not\nmerely a baseline score but a qualitative severity rating (e.g., low, medium,\nhigh, critical). The CVSS baseline score is recommended to be complemented with\nenvironmental analysis and attributes that may evolve over time (such as threat\nindicators), aiding organizations in prioritizing their vulnerability management\nprocesses and enhancing cyber-attack defenses. This update introduces a new\nnomenclature for calculating CVSS scores, including combinations of Base\n(CVSS-B), Base + Threat (CVSS-BT), Base + Environmental (CVSS-BE), and Base +\nThreat + Environmental (CVSS-BTE). \nThe release of CVSS 4.0 marks a substantial advancement, equipping teams with\nenhanced capabilities vital for precise assessment using threat analysis and\nenvironmental indicators.", "metadata": {"id": "1b3db500-2ab7-67d6-8759-06e934b3b208", "receivedDateTime": "2023-11-14T19:12:37+00:00", "topic": "November Patch Tuesday Analysis by Action1", "subject": "[patchmanagement] November Patch Tuesday Analysis by Action1", "published": "2023-11-14T00:00:00", "collection": "patch_management", "cve_fixes": "", "cve_mentions": null, "tags": "", "conversation_link": "//groups.google.com/d/msgid/patchmanagement/d9d32576-bf61-4e1e-ac57-910bd685a64cn%40googlegroups.com", "email_text_original": "Quick summary: \n\u2022 Windows: 63 vulnerabilities, three zero-days, three critical\n\u2022 Microsoft Exchange, Microsoft Access, Microsoft 365: vulnerabilities\nidentified by researchers\n\u2022 Chrome: 15 vulnerabilities\n\u2022 Firefox: 25 vulnerabilities\n\u2022 Veeam ONE: four vulnerabilities, two with CVSS 9.8 and 9.9\n\u2022 Apache ActiveMQ: CVE-2023-46604 (CVSS 10!)\n\u2022 Atlassian: 28 vulnerabilities, including zero-day CVE-2023-22515 with CVSS 10!\nand CVE-2019-13990 with CVSS 9.8\n\u2022 Kubernetes ingress-nginx: CVE-2022-4886, CVE-2023-5043, and CVE-2023-5044\n\u2022 Cisco: zero-days CVE-2023-20198 and CVE-2023-20273\n\u2022 Citrix: zero-day CVE-2023-4966 with CVSS 9.4\n\u2022 VMware: CVE-2023-34051 with CVSS 9.8 and CVE-2023-34048 with CVSS 9.8\n\u2022 SolarWinds: several vulnerabilities, including CVE-2023-35182, CVE-2023-35185\nand CVE-2023-35187\n\u2022 Oracle: 387 patched vulnerabilities\n\u2022 Exim: three zero-days\n\u2022 SysAid: zero-day CVE-2023-47246 \nSource (updated in\nreal-time):\u00a0https://www.action1.com/patch-tuesday-november-2023/?vmp\n[https://can01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.action1.com%2Fpatch-tuesday-november-2023%2F%3Fvmp&data=05%7C01%7Cemail_ingestion%40bighatgroup.com%7C34fc4745194c4a0ce46608dbe545a6b5%7C5a01497e1bcb4711b6e6d24f4ab00393%7C0%7C0%7C638355859574001009%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=NN%2FDWPflW00NZXyjarmRZwN%2FHDqcAke27ERvJW1hbV8%3D&reserved=0] \nWhile we observe a decrease in the number of fixes this month, with 63\nvulnerabilities addressed compared to October\u2019s count, the volume remains\nnoteworthy, particularly when considering third-party updates as well. This\nbatch includes three zero-day fixes and three vulnerabilities for which proofs\nof concept exist. It encompasses three critical fixes, a significant reduction\nfrom last month. Here are details on the most interesting critical updates. \nWindows Cloud Files Mini Filter Driver Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability \nThe CVE-2023-36036 vulnerability, identified today, is a critical zero-day\nelevation of privilege issue affecting Microsoft Windows 10 and later, as well\nas Microsoft Windows Server 2008 and onwards. With a CVSS score of 7.8, it is\nconsidered a significant threat according to Microsoft\u2019s assessment criteria.\nThe vulnerability, which requires local access, is of low complexity and can be\nexploited without high-level privileges or user interaction. Successful\nexploitation allows attackers to gain SYSTEM-level privileges, making it an\nideal tool for escalating privileges after initial access, such as through\nphishing. \nMicrosoft urgently recommends updating systems to address this vulnerability,\nwhich is already being exploited in active attacks, although no proof of concept\nis currently available. \nWindows DWM Core Library Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability \nCVE-2023-36033 is a zero-day vulnerability targeting the Windows DWM Core\nLibrary, presenting an elevation of privilege risk. It shares traits with\nCVE-2023-36036, notably a CVSS score of 7.8. This vulnerability can be exploited\nlocally, with low complexity and without needing high-level privileges or user\ninteraction. Attackers exploiting this flaw could gain SYSTEM privileges, making\nit an efficient method for escalating privileges, especially after initial\naccess through methods like phishing. It affects Microsoft Windows 10 and later,\nas well as Microsoft Windows Server 2019 and subsequent versions. \nUnlike the previous vulnerability, there is a proof of concept available for\nCVE-2023-36033, and Microsoft has confirmed its active exploitation. Therefore,\nMicrosoft urgently advises applying the available updates to mitigate this\nvulnerability. \nWindows SmartScreen Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability \nCVE-2023-36025 is a zero-day vulnerability in the Windows SmartScreen feature,\nposing a significant security bypass risk. Unlike the other vulnerabilities\nmentioned, this one has a network attack vector and requires user interaction,\nthough it still maintains low attack complexity and doesn\u2019t require high\nprivileges. Notably, it has a high CVSS rating of 8.8. \nThis vulnerability impacts Microsoft Windows 10 and later versions, as well as\nMicrosoft Windows Server 2008 and subsequent releases. It enables attackers to\ncircumvent Windows Defender SmartScreen checks and prompts. To exploit this\nflaw, a user must interact with a malicious Internet shortcut (.URL) or a\nhyperlink directing to such a shortcut. This exploitation allows attackers to\nprevent Windows Smart Screen from blocking malware. \nMicrosoft has confirmed that this vulnerability is currently being exploited in\nactive attacks, although no proof of concept is available as of now. Given its\nhigh CVSS rating and the fact that it is being actively exploited, this makes\nCVE-2023-36025 one of the vulnerabilities that should be prioritized for\npatching. \nMicrosoft Exchange \nMicrosoft has chosen to overlook four vulnerabilities in its Exchange mail\nserver, identified by Peter Bazydlo of the Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative\n(ZDI). These vulnerabilities, comprising three Server-Side Request Forgery\n(SSRF) issues and one Remote Code Execution (RCE), are currently tracked as\nZDI-23-1578, ZDI-23-1579, ZDI-23-1580, and ZDI-23-1581, pending the assignment\nof CVE identifiers. \nZDI reported these vulnerabilities to Microsoft on September 7-8. Microsoft\nacknowledged them on September 11 but later, between September 27-29, indicated\nthat these vulnerabilities do not necessitate \u201cimmediate maintenance.\u201d \nContrary to their initial classification as zero-day vulnerabilities in the\ndisclosure to ZDI, Microsoft does not categorize them as such. The rationale is\nthat they have not been exploited in the wild, nor is there any publicly\navailable proof-of-concept. Additionally, exploiting these vulnerabilities\nrequires authentication, which diminishes the likelihood of their malicious use.\nNotably, one of these vulnerabilities, ZDI-23-1578, which involves a data\ndeserialization issue leading to remote code execution, was already addressed in\nthe August Patch Tuesday update. \nMicrosoft has emphasized that exploiting each of these security issues\nnecessitates prior access to email credentials. The company also stated that for\ntwo of these vulnerabilities, there is no evidence suggesting they could be used\nfor privilege escalation or to access sensitive customer data. \nMicrosoft Access \nResearchers at Check Point Research have identified a security vulnerability in\nMicrosoft Access that could potentially allow an attacker to acquire a Windows\nuser\u2019s NTLM token. This vulnerability can be exploited via any TCP port,\nincluding port 80, when a user opens an .accdb or .mdb file. This method\neffectively circumvents existing firewall rules that are meant to prevent the\ntheft of NTLM credentials. \nNTLM, an outdated authentication protocol introduced by Microsoft in 1993, is\nsusceptible to three well-known types of attacks: brute force, pass-the-hash,\nand relay attacks. The vulnerability leverages a feature in Microsoft Access\nknown as \u201cLinked Tables,\u201d which enables Access databases to link to tables in\nother databases. Check Point notes that this feature is not covered by local\nfirewall rules, thereby allowing attackers to exploit it to transmit NTLM hashes\nacross the network. \nFurthermore, the Check Point specialists have also described a method to bypass\nprotections that block all outbound traffic on ports typically used by the NTLM\nprotocol (139 and 445). This bypass exploits the \u201cAccess Link Tables\u201d feature in\nthe Microsoft Access application. \nMicrosoft 365 \nZscaler\u2019s ThreatLabz team has identified an alarming number of\nvulnerabilities\u2014117 in total\u2014in Microsoft 365 applications for both Windows and\nMac. This surge in security flaws stems from the integration of the SketchUp 3D\nlibrary. Microsoft introduced support for SketchUp files (SKP) in June 2022,\ninadvertently introducing numerous bugs into Microsoft 365. These\nvulnerabilities were uncovered through three months of thorough research by the\nThreatLabz team. Initially, only four SKP-related bugs were identified in\nMicrosoft Office as part of the Zero Day Initiative by the end of December 2022.\nThis discovery prompted the ThreatLabz researchers to examine the problematic\ncomponent more closely. \nMicrosoft has responded by assigning identifiers CVE-2023-28285, CVE-2023-29344,\nand CVE-2023-33146 to track these vulnerabilities. Although a patch was released\nby Microsoft to address these issues, ThreatLabz successfully found ways to\nbypass it. \nIn response to these findings, Microsoft took preventive steps in June 2023 by\ntemporarily disabling SketchUp support in Microsoft 365. The researchers have\ncomprehensively detailed their detection methods and the technical aspects of\nsome of these vulnerabilities in a report. The first part of this report has\nbeen published, with the second part expected to be available shortly. \nGoogle Chrome \nIn its latest version 119, the Google Chrome browser has addressed 15 security\nvulnerabilities. These include three high-criticality, eight medium-criticality,\nand two low-criticality vulnerabilities. Among the most critical are\nCVE-2023-5480, which relates to implementation errors in the payment system, and\nCVE-2023-5482, involving incorrect data validation in USB functionalities. \nMany of these vulnerabilities were detected through automated testing using\ntools like AddressSanitizer, MemorySanitizer, Control Flow Integrity, LibFuzzer,\nand AFL. \nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that these vulnerabilities do not compromise all\nlayers of the browser\u2019s protection. They are unable to allow code execution on\nthe system outside of Chrome\u2019s sandbox environment. As part of its security\nbounty program for this release, Google has awarded a total of $40.5K across 13\ndifferent bounties. \nMozilla Firefox \nMozilla\u2019s latest release, Firefox 119, not only brings new features and bug\nfixes but also includes 25 security updates. Of these, 17 vulnerabilities,\nprimarily grouped under CVE-2023-5730 and CVE-2023-5731, are classified as\ndangerous due to memory-related issues. These include buffer overflows and\naccessing previously freed memory areas, which could potentially enable an\nattacker to execute code when specific, specially crafted web pages are\naccessed. \nAdditionally, a separate critical vulnerability, identified as CVE-2023-5721,\nposes a risk by allowing clickjacking. This vulnerability could be exploited to\nmanipulate users into inadvertently confirming or canceling certain browser\ndialogues or warnings. \nVeeam ONE \nVeeam has recently issued patches for four vulnerabilities in its Veeam ONE\nmonitoring and analysis platform, including two critical Remote Code Execution\n(RCE) vulnerabilities with high CVSS base scores of 9.8 and 9.9 out of 10. \nThe first critical vulnerability, CVE-2023-38547, could allow an unauthenticated\nuser to access information about the SQL Server connection used by Veeam ONE for\nits configuration database. The second, CVE-2023-38548, enables an\nunauthenticated user with access to the Veeam ONE web client to obtain an\naccount\u2019s NTLM hash. \nAdditionally, Veeam has rectified a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability,\nidentified as CVE-2023-38549. This flaw could be exploited to acquire an\nadministrator access token and requires communication to be effective. \nThe fourth vulnerability addressed, CVE-2023-41723, could be exploited by an\nattacker with read-only user privileges to access dashboard schedules. However,\nthis vulnerability does not allow the attacker to make any changes. \nThese vulnerabilities impact all actively supported versions of Veeam ONE up to\nthe latest version. The fixes are included in Veeam ONE 12 P20230314 (version\n12.0.1.2591), Veeam ONE 11a (version 11.0.1.1880), and Veeam ONE 11 (version\n11.0.0.1379). \nApache ActiveMQ \nApache ActiveMQ\nA critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability has been identified in over\n3,000 publicly accessible Apache ActiveMQ servers. Apache ActiveMQ, known for\nits scalability, is an open-source message broker that supports Java and various\ncross-language clients, along with multiple protocols like AMQP, MQTT, OpenWire,\nand STOMP. It\u2019s widely used in enterprise environments for system communication\nwithout direct connectivity, thanks to its range of secure authentication and\nauthorization mechanisms. \nThe vulnerability, designated as CVE-2023-46604, is rated 10.0 on the CVSS v3\nscale. It allows attackers to execute arbitrary shell commands by utilizing\nserialized class types in the OpenWire protocol. \nAs per Apache\u2019s advisory on October 27, the issue impacts Apache Active MQ and\nthe legacy OpenWire module versions from 5.18.x through 5.18.3, 5.17.x through\n5.17.6, 5.16.x through 5.16.7, down to version 5.15.16. Fixes were released on\nthe same day for versions 5.15.16, 5.16.7, 5.17.6, and 5.18.3. \nResearchers from ArcticWolf and Huntress Labs discovered attacks exploiting\nCVE-2023-46604 to deploy SparkRAT malware on ActiveMQ servers starting as early\nas October 10, well before Apache released the patch on October 25. \nFurthermore, even after the patch release, over 9,200 Apache ActiveMQ servers\nremained open on the network, with more than 4,770 still vulnerable to exploits\ntargeting CVE-2023-46604. Following this, ransomware attacks were observed, with\nsome of the compromised servers being encrypted by HelloKitty, followed by\nTellYouThePass, as noted by researchers from Huntress Labs and Rapid7. \nGiven Apache ActiveMQ\u2019s critical role as a message broker in enterprise\nenvironments, the exploitation of CVE-2023-46604 poses severe risks, including\npotential lateral movement across the network. With the technical details of\nexploiting CVE-2023-46604 publicly available, it is imperative and urgent for\nsecurity updates to be applied. \nAtlassian \nOn October 17th, Atlassian issued a security bulletin announcing patches for 28\nvulnerabilities in their software, including two critical and 26 high-risk\nissues. \nThe most severe vulnerabilities are CVE-2023-22515, with a maximum severity\nscore of 10.0, affecting all Confluence Data Center and Server versions, and\nCVE-2019-13990, scoring 9.8, impacting Jira Service Management Data Center and\nServer. The majority of the other significant vulnerabilities have a 7.5 rating,\nexcept for CVE-2023-22514 at 7.8 and CVE-2021-22569 at 5.5. \nA Proof of Concept (PoC) for CVE-2023-22515, a zero-day vulnerability in\nAtlassian Confluence, was incorporated into Metasploit after several operational\nexploit versions were leaked. Notably, this vulnerability was actively exploited\nby an attacker, known as DarkShadow or Oro0lxy, starting September 14, 2023,\nprior to its official disclosure on October 4. \nAnother grave concern is CVE-2023-22518, a critical vulnerability in Confluence\nthat could lead to substantial data loss due to improper authorization. This\nflaw affects all versions of Confluence Data Center and Server, though it does\nnot threaten data privacy. Atlassian has addressed this in specific Confluence\nversions. If upgrading isn\u2019t possible, implementing mitigating measures such as\nbackups and restricting Internet access is recommended. \nThe release of a publicly accessible PoC for CVE-2023-22518 has triggered active\nexploitation of this vulnerability. Security firms GreyNoise and Rapid7 have\nobserved extensive campaigns exploiting CVE-2023-22518 and the older critical\nbug CVE-2023-22515. These attacks have often involved deploying the Cerber\nransomware on compromised servers. \nThis event marks the second significant instance of CerberImposter ransomware\nbeing used in attacks, following a previous campaign against Atlassian\nConfluence that exploited the RCE vulnerability CVE-2021-26084 two years\nearlier. \nKubernetes ingress-nginx \nThree high-severity vulnerabilities, currently unpatched, have been identified\nin the NGINX controller for Kubernetes. These vulnerabilities could potentially\nallow an attacker to access sensitive credentials within a Kubernetes cluster. \nThe ingress controller in Kubernetes serves as a gateway, managing external\nnetwork access to services within the cluster. The widely-used ingress-nginx\ncontroller, distinct from the Kubernetes basic ingress controllers for AWS, GCE,\nand nginx, leverages the NGINX server for forwarding access, routing external\nrequests, and load balancing. Notably, the ingress-nginx controller is\nmaintained separately by F5/NGINX and is not affiliated with the Kubernetes\nproject\u2019s nginx controller. \nThe vulnerabilities are as follows: \n* * CVE-2022-4886 (CVSS score: 8.8): This vulnerability allows bypassing path\n     sanitization in Ingress-nginx, enabling access to Ingress-nginx controller\n     credentials.\n   * CVE-2023-5043 (CVSS score: 7.6): This allows the injection of an\n     Ingress-nginx annotation to execute arbitrary commands.\n   * CVE-2023-5044 (CVSS score: 7.6): This involves code injection through the\n     nginx.ingress.kubernetes[.io]/permanent-redirect annotation. \nCVE-2022-4886 specifically involves inadequate validation in the\n\u201cspec.rules[].http.paths[].path\u201d field of the Ingress object. An attacker with\naccess to Ingress could exploit this to download Kubernetes API credentials from\nthe ingress controller. The vulnerability arises because the application does\nnot sufficiently verify the validity of internal paths, which could be\nmanipulated to point to internal files containing service account tokens for\nauthenticating to the API server. \nIn the absence of an official patch, software developers have suggested\nmitigations. These include enabling the strict-validate-path-type option and\nusing the \u2013enable-annotation-validation flag. These measures are designed to\nprevent the creation of Ingress objects with invalid characters and enforce\nadditional restrictions. ARMO recommends updating NGINX to version 1.19 and\nadding the \u2013enable-annotation-validation command line configuration to resolve\nCVE-2023-5043 and CVE-2023-5044. \nCisco \nCisco is cautioning customers about a new zero-day vulnerability in IOS XE,\nidentified as CVE-2023-20198, that could potentially compromise devices. This\ncritical issue, a privilege escalation vulnerability, affects the default\nimage\u2019s IOS XE web user interface. The vulnerability, exploitable from the\nnetwork or directly from the Internet, allows an unauthenticated remote attacker\nto create a high-privilege account (level 15 access) and gain full control of\nthe device. Such access enables an attacker to alter network routing rules, open\nports to connect to attacker-controlled servers, and steal data. \nCisco Talos detected malicious activity related to CVE-2023-20198 on September\n28, following unusual activity on a customer\u2019s device. Analysis revealed the\ncreation of a new user account named \u201ccisco_tac_admin\u201d as early as September 18.\nThis activity paused on October 1 but resumed on October 12, believed to be by\nthe same attacker. In September, the hackers merely created a new account, but\nin October, they also deployed an implant consisting of a configuration file,\nenabling them to execute arbitrary commands at the system or IOS level. \nThe implant was delivered by exploiting CVE-2021-1435, a command injection\nvulnerability in IOS XE that Cisco had patched in March 2021. However, the\nimplant was also observed on devices patched for CVE-2021-1435, with the\ndelivery mechanism in these cases remaining unidentified. The implant is not\npermanent, disappearing after a device reboot, but the attacker-created accounts\nremain active. \nResearchers have documented extensive zero-day attacks on the Cisco IOS XE\noperating system. VulnCheck discovered thousands of compromised Cisco IOS XE\nsystems with the web user interface feature enabled and released a scanner for\nmalicious implants, while LeakIX reported more than 30,000 such systems. Over\n34,500 Cisco IOS XE devices have been compromised by CVE-2023-20198 attacks,\naccording to Orange\u2019s CERT Coordination Center. Shodan\u2019s data indicates that\nover 140,000 web-enabled Cisco devices are currently online. \nGreyNoise has identified nearly 42,000 Cisco routers and switches worldwide with\na malicious implant installed. The scope of the Cisco IOS XE zero-day impact has\nwidened with the discovery of a similar vulnerability, CVE-2023-20273. Rockwell\nAutomation informed customers about an actively exploited zero-day affecting\nStratix industrial switches. Unknown attackers exploited two zero-day\nvulnerabilities in Cisco IOS XE (CVE-2023-20198 and CVE-2023-20273) to create\nhigh-privilege accounts and deploy a Lua implant for full system control. The\nRockwell advisory, issued before the second zero-day discovery, does not mention\nCVE-2023-20273, but this vulnerability also impacts IOS XE software on Rockwell\nswitches. \nA publicly available exploit for the critical Cisco IOS XE vulnerability\n(CVE-2023-20198) emerged from a trap study by SECUINFRA. Horizon3.ai researchers\ndetailed how attackers can bypass authentication on vulnerable Cisco IOS XE\ndevices. They can encode an HTTP request to the WMSA service in iosd, a key\nbinary in Cisco IOS XE, to generate a configuration file for OpenResty (a\nNginx-based server with Lua scripting) used by the vulnerable webui service.\nWSMA enables command execution via SOAP requests, including access to a\nconfiguration function to create a fully privileged user. The researchers\ndemonstrated how the bug could be exploited to create a new user with level 15\nprivileges, granting full device control and the ability to write malicious\nimplants directly to the hard drive. \nLeakIX researchers confirmed the exploit\u2019s effectiveness, detecting specific\ncommand executions on their Cisco IOS XE decoys. Consequently, Cisco updated its\nadvisory for CVE-2023-20198, announcing IOS XE updates containing fixes for the\nvulnerability. Despite Cisco releasing patches for most IOS XE software\nversions, thousands of systems remain vulnerable. \nCisco also released software updates addressing 27 vulnerabilities across its\nAdaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Management Center (FMC), and\nFirepower Threat Defense (FTD) products, and issued 22 security advisories. The\nmost severe is CVE-2023-20048, with a CVSS rating of 9.9, caused by insufficient\nauthorization of configuration commands in the FMC web service interface. An\nattacker could exploit this using crafted HTTP requests to execute configuration\ncommands on the targeted FTD device. \nSeven advisories describe eight flaws in ASA, FMC, and FTD software, with five\npotentially leading to Denial of Service (DoS) and the rest permitting command\ninjection. The DoS vulnerabilities impact ICMPv6 processing, VPNs, internal\npacket processing, and ICMPv6 inspection using Snort 2 features and APIs in\nthese products. \nEighteen moderate vulnerabilities in ASA, FMC, and FTD could result in DoS,\narbitrary file uploads, SAML hijacking, XSS attacks, policy bypass, discovery\nmechanism bypass, certificate authentication bypass, and geolocation filter\nbypass. The most severe, CVE-2022-20713, exploitable remotely without\nauthentication, manipulates client requests in the VPN services component of ASA\nand FTD software. \nThe issue was discovered on August 10, 2022, and it took over a year for Cisco\nto provide a patch. Despite the public availability of the PoC exploit, there\nhave been no reported real-world exploits. \nUsers with publicly accessible Cisco devices are advised to update them as soon\nas possible or restrict their internet access to mitigate these vulnerabilities. \nCitrix \nMandiant has issued a warning about the use of a recently patched zero-day\nvulnerability in Citrix NetScaler Application Delivery Controller (ADC) and\nNetScaler Gateway, identified as CVE-2023-4966, in attacks observed since\nAugust. This vulnerability, with a CVSS rating of 9.4, allows unauthorized\naccess to steal sensitive information from devices set up as a gateway or AAA\nvirtual server. Citrix released fixes for the NetScaler ADC and Gateway on\nOctober 10, initially not highlighting the exploit potential. However, they\nsubsequently updated their advisory to alert customers about the exploitation of\nCVE-2023-4966 and urged immediate updating of their systems. \nThe resolved versions of the bug include NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway\nversions 14.1-8.50, 13.1-49.15, and 13.0-92.19, as well as specific FIPS and\nNDcPP versions. Mandiant noted that the vulnerability has been exploited in\nattacks targeting the government sector and technology companies since August.\nAttackers successfully exploiting this vulnerability could hijack authenticated\nsessions, circumventing multi-factor authentication. These sessions might\npersist even after the CVE-2023-4966 fix is applied. Researchers also observed\ninstances where data was stolen before patching and later used by attackers. \nSession hijacking of this nature can give attackers wider access, enabling them\nto collect credentials, move laterally within networks, and access further\nresources in compromised environments. Mandiant\u2019s remediation guide advises\nisolating NetScaler ADC and gateway instances before patching, restricting\naccess to unpatched devices, updating devices, terminating all active sessions\npost-update, and scanning for malicious activity. They also recommend restoring\ninfected devices from clean backups, changing credentials if remote access is\nenabled with single-factor authentication, and limiting inbound access to\ntrusted or pre-defined IP address ranges. \nAdditionally, a Proof of Concept (PoC) for the Citrix Bleed vulnerability\n(CVE-2023-4966) has been released. Assetnote researchers have elaborated on the\nexploitation of CVE-2023-4966 and published a PoC exploit on GitHub to\ndemonstrate their findings and assist in verifying the vulnerability. With the\nCVE-2023-4966 exploit now public, an increase in attacks against Citrix\nNetscaler appliances is expected for initial access to corporate networks. This\nprediction was confirmed by Shadowserver, which reported a surge in exploitation\nattempts after the PoC advisory\u2019s release. Due to the typical use of such\nvulnerabilities in ransomware and data theft attacks, system administrators are\nstrongly urged to promptly install the necessary patches. \nVMware \nVMware has issued a warning about an authentication bypass vulnerability in\nvRealize Log Insight (VMware Aria Operations for Logs), identified as\nCVE-2023-34051. This vulnerability, for which a PoC is available, enables an\nunauthenticated attacker to execute code remotely with root privileges under\nspecific conditions. \nThe Horizon3 researchers, who discovered the bug, noted that successful\nexploitation relies on permissions to add an interface or static IP address.\nHorizon3\u2019s technical analysis of the vulnerability\u2019s root cause provides insight\ninto how CVE-2023-34051 can be exploited for Remote Code Execution (RCE) with\nroot privileges on unpatched VMware devices. They have also published a PoC\nexploit and a list of Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) to detect hacking\nattempts. The exploit leverages IP address spoofing and Thrift RPC endpoints to\nwrite arbitrary files, typically creating a reverse shell via a cron job, though\nthe payload file requires modification to suit the environment. The attacker\nmust share the same IP address as the master/work node for the attack to\nsucceed. This vulnerability effectively serves as a workaround for a series of\ncritical bugs fixed by VMware in January, which also allow RCE. \nThese include CVE-2022-31706 (a directory traversal bug), CVE-2022-31704 (an\naccess control violation), and CVE-2022-31711 (an information disclosure bug),\ncollectively known as VMSA-2023-0001. Attackers could exploit these to inject\nmalicious files into devices running unpatched Aria Operations for Logs\nsoftware. Following the patch for VMSA-2023-0001, Horizon3 released a PoC that\nexploits Thrift RPC endpoints for arbitrary file writes. \nThe vulnerability is relatively easy to exploit but requires attackers to have\nspecific infrastructure configurations to serve the malicious payload. As the\nproduct is unlikely to be exposed on the Internet, attackers need initial\nnetwork access, making vulnerable VMware appliances valuable targets for lateral\nmovement within compromised networks. \nVMware has also patched a critical RCE vulnerability in vCenter Server,\ndesignated as CVE-2023-34048 with a CVSS rating of 9.8, discovered by Grigory\nDorodnov from the Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative. It involves an out-of-range\nwrite vulnerability in the DCE/RPC protocol implementation, exploitable by an\nattacker with network access to vCenter Server, potentially leading to RCE. \nThe updates for this vulnerability are available in VMware vCenter Server 8.0\n(8.0U1d or 8.0U2), VMware vCenter Server 7.0 (7.0U3o), VMware Cloud Foundation\n5.x, and 4.x. Additionally, VMware issued a patch for vCenter Server versions\n6.7U3, 6.5U3, and VCF 3.x. The latest update also addresses CVE-2023-34056, a\npartial information disclosure vulnerability in vCenter. \nWhile there are no known real-world exploitations of these vulnerabilities,\nVMware strongly advises customers to promptly apply patches to mitigate\npotential threats. \nCisco \nCisco has recently unveiled a series of patches aimed at addressing various\nvulnerabilities, among them a moderately severe vulnerability found in IOS and\nIOS XE software that has exhibited signs of exploitation. \nDesignated as CVE-2023-20109, this vulnerability pertains to the Group Encrypted\nTransport VPN (GET VPN) feature within IOS and IOS XE and carries the potential\nfor Remote Code Execution (RCE). To successfully exploit this vulnerability, an\nattacker necessitates valid credentials and administrative control over a group\nmember or key server. The root issue stems from inadequate attribute validation\nwithin the Group Domain of Interpretation (GDOI) and G-IKEv2 protocols utilized\nin the GET VPN function. \nThis vulnerability affects all Cisco products operating on vulnerable versions\nof IOS or IOS XE with the GDOI or G-IKEv2 protocol enabled. Unfortunately, there\nexists no viable workaround for this vulnerability, thus prompting Cisco to\nstrongly recommend that customers apply updates. This is especially crucial\nconsidering documented attempts to exploit this vulnerability uncovered in an\ninternal investigation. \nAdditionally, Cisco has rolled out patches for various vulnerabilities in the\nCatalyst SD-WAN Manager product, including a critical vulnerability\n(CVE-2023-20252) within the SAML APIs. This vulnerability carries a CVSS rating\nof 9.8 and could potentially enable an unauthenticated attacker to gain\nunauthorized access to the application on behalf of an arbitrary user. This\nvulnerability was addressed alongside four other high-severity issues, each\nposing unique threats, such as bypassing authorization and rollback of\ncontroller configurations, accessing the Elasticsearch system database, reaching\nanother tenant managed on the same instance, or causing a Denial of Service\n(DoS) situation. \nCisco has also taken measures to rectify other significant issues, spanning RCE,\nDoS, unauthorized data access, and file theft, through software updates for IOS,\nIOS XE, and Cisco DNA Center. Additionally, the company has addressed several\nmoderately severe issues impacting its products. \nIt\u2019s noteworthy that, aside from CVE-2023-20109, Cisco currently possesses no\nknowledge of these vulnerabilities being actively exploited in any attacks. \nSolarWinds \nSolarWinds has remediated critical vulnerabilities in its Access Rights Manager\n(ARM) software, which is designed for managing user access rights in IT\nenvironments. This includes integration with Microsoft Active Directory,\nrole-based access management, and visual feedback, among other features. \nOn June 22, researchers participating in the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI)\nidentified eight bugs in SolarWinds ARM, three of which were classified as\ncritical. These include: \n* * CVE-2023-35182 (rated 9.8): This vulnerability allows unauthenticated\n     remote attackers to execute arbitrary code with system-level privileges. It\n     stems from untrusted data deserialization in the\n     createGlobalServerChannelInternal method.\n   * CVE-2023-35185 (rated 9.8): This issue permits unauthenticated remote\n     attackers to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM-level privileges. The\n     vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-entered paths in\n     the OpenFile method.\n   * CVE-2023-35187 (rated 9.8): Similar to the others, this vulnerability\n     enables unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary code with\n     SYSTEM-level privileges. This is possible because of inadequate validation\n     of user-supplied paths in the OpenClientUpdateFile method. \nIn addition to these critical vulnerabilities, SolarWinds also patched several\nother issues rated as high severity, which could potentially be exploited to\ngain elevated privileges or remote code execution on a host following\nauthentication. To mitigate these vulnerabilities, SolarWinds released a patch\nin version 2023.2.1 of its Access Rights Manager. The company also issued\nadvisories detailing all eight vulnerabilities, including their severity as\nassessed by SolarWinds. Notably, the company itself did not categorize any of\nthe vulnerabilities as critical but assigned the highest rating of 8.8 for those\nconsidered high severity. \nOracle \nOracle has rolled out a scheduled Critical Patch Update for its range of\nproducts, addressing a significant number of security vulnerabilities. In total,\nthe update rectifies 387 security issues across various Oracle products. Key\nvulnerabilities addressed in this update include: \n* Java SE and GraalVM for JDK: This update fixes three vulnerabilities in Java\n   SE and four in GraalVM for JDK. All these vulnerabilities are capable of\n   being remotely exploited without authentication in environments that permit\n   the execution of untrusted code. In Java SE, the most severe vulnerabilities,\n   located in CORBA and JSSE, have a threat level of 5.3. GraalVM\u2019s most\n   critical vulnerability, found in Node.js, carries a threat level of 7.5.\n   These issues have been resolved in Java SE versions 21.0.1 and 17.0.9.\n * MySQL Server: Of the 26 vulnerabilities patched in MySQL Server, two are\n   capable of remote exploitation. The most significant vulnerabilities,\n   impacting the Curl package, the OpenSSL library, and the optimizer, have\n   severity ratings of 7.5 and 6.5. Lesser issues affect the optimizer, InnoDB,\n   DDL, UDF, and encryption tools. These vulnerabilities will be fixed in\n   upcoming MySQL Community Server releases 8.2.0, 8.0.35, and 5.7.44.\n * VirtualBox: Three vulnerabilities in VirtualBox, with threat levels of 7.9\n   and 7.3, have been addressed. These vulnerabilities are fixed in the\n   VirtualBox 7.0.12 update, with branch 6.1 not being affected by these issues.\n * Solaris: Two vulnerabilities in Solaris, impacting the kernel and file\n   system, have been identified and addressed, with threat levels of 5.5 and\n   3.1. These issues are resolved in the Solaris 11.4 SRU62 update. The update\n   also includes enhancements and fixes to several packages, including python\n   3.7.17, rabbitmq 3.8.35, Firefox 102.15.0esr, Thunderbird 102.15.0, pcre2\n   10.42, unrar 6.2.10, PHP 8.2.10, Tomcat 8.5.93, mod_jk 1.2.49, cups, perl,\n   ucups, and zfs. \nGiven the critical nature of these vulnerabilities, it is highly recommended for\nusers of Oracle products to apply these updates promptly to mitigate potential\nsecurity risks. \nExim \nThe development team of the Exim mail server has issued a security update\naddressing the final three out of six zero-day vulnerabilities that were\ndisclosed as part of the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI). The three most critical\nvulnerabilities among these were initially patched in early October. \nWith this latest update, all six vulnerabilities originally identified by\nresearchers in the ZDI have now been remediated. Additionally, Exim has\nannounced the deprecation of all previous versions of the Exim server. As a\nresult, only the current version, 4.96.2, is officially supported going forward.\nThis decision underscores the importance of updating to the latest version for\nenhanced security and support. \nSysAid \nCl0p ransomware operators have launched a significant new campaign targeting\ncustomers of SysAid, an IT management software provider. SysAid is alerting its\ncustomers about a critical vulnerability, CVE-2023-47246, which is being\nactively exploited by ransomware groups. \nThe zero-day exploit was initially detected by Microsoft\u2019s threat analysis team,\nwho promptly informed SysAid about the ongoing attacks. SysAid confirmed that\nits on-premises software was impacted by this vulnerability, characterized as a\npath traversal issue that leads to Remote Code Execution (RCE). SysAid became\naware of the zero-day on November 2. By November 8, they announced the release\nof version 23.3.36, specifically designed to address this vulnerability.\nAlongside this fix, SysAid has also provided details about the attacks they\nobserved, along with Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) and advisories. \nMicrosoft has linked CVE-2023-47246 to the activities of Lace Tempest (also\nknown as DEV-0950), a threat actor whose operations are associated with the\nFIN11 and TA505 groups, both known for using Cl0p ransomware. Microsoft had\npreviously connected this operator to the widespread exploitation of the MOVEit\nTransfer zero-day, which affected over 2,500 organizations. In the recent\nattacks on SysAid, the hackers leveraged IT support software to deploy MeshAgent\nand GraceWire, typically followed by lateral movement within networks, data\ntheft, and ransomware deployment. SysAid also noted that the attackers used a\nPowerShell script to erase traces and evidence from the targeted servers. \nCVSS 4.0 \nOver eight years after the release of CVSS v3.0 and eighteen years since the\ndebut of its first version in February 2005, FIRST (Forum of Incident Response\nand Security Teams) has launched the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)\n4.0. This update, involving more than 650 organizations from over 100 countries,\nwas initially introduced at the 35th Annual Conference in Montreal in June,\nrepresenting a significant evolution for the cyber sector. \nCVSS 4.0 aims to address previous ambiguities in severity ratings of\nvulnerabilities. It enhances the standard by offering more detailed baseline\ngranularity for users, clarifying the assessment of different levels, and\nimproving the evaluation of environment-specific security requirements and\ncompensating controls. \nThis latest version of CVSS introduces additional metrics for vulnerability\nassessment, such as security (S), automation (A), recovery (R), value density\n(V), response effort (RE), and vendor urgency (U). A notable improvement in CVSS\nv4.0 is its expanded applicability to Operational Technology (OT), Industrial\nControl Systems (ICS), and the Internet of Things (IoT), with added security\nmetrics and values in both the additional and environmental metrics groups. \nThe CVSS standard is designed to identify essential characteristics of security\nvulnerabilities and generate a numerical rating reflecting their technical\nseverity, offering information and guidance. FIRST emphasizes that CVSS is not\nmerely a baseline score but a qualitative severity rating (e.g., low, medium,\nhigh, critical). The CVSS baseline score is recommended to be complemented with\nenvironmental analysis and attributes that may evolve over time (such as threat\nindicators), aiding organizations in prioritizing their vulnerability management\nprocesses and enhancing cyber-attack defenses. This update introduces a new\nnomenclature for calculating CVSS scores, including combinations of Base\n(CVSS-B), Base + Threat (CVSS-BT), Base + Environmental (CVSS-BE), and Base +\nThreat + Environmental (CVSS-BTE). \nThe release of CVSS 4.0 marks a substantial advancement, equipping teams with\nenhanced capabilities vital for precise assessment using threat analysis and\nenvironmental indicators. \n------------------ \nSource: Action1 Vulnerability Digest\n[https://can01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.action1.com%2Fpatch-tuesday-november-2023%2F%3Fvmp&data=05%7C01%7Cemail_ingestion%40bighatgroup.com%7C34fc4745194c4a0ce46608dbe545a6b5%7C5a01497e1bcb4711b6e6d24f4ab00393%7C0%7C0%7C638355859574001009%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=NN%2FDWPflW00NZXyjarmRZwN%2FHDqcAke27ERvJW1hbV8%3D&reserved=0]\u00a0(updated\nin real-time) \n--\nLink: https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/patchmanagement/d9d32576-bf61-4e1e-ac57-910bd685a64cn%40googlegroups.com \n", "evaluated_keywords": "['windows cloud files mini filter driver elevation', 'update rectify 387 security issue across various oracle product', 'windows smartscreen security feature bypass vulnerability cve', 'method effectively circumvent exist firewall rule', 'automate testing use tool like addresssanitizer', 'impact jira service management data center', 'announce ios xe update contain fix']", "evaluated_noun_chunks": "['Quick summary', 'Windows', 'Microsoft Exchange', 'Microsoft Access', 'Atlassian', 'Kubernetes ingress-nginx', 'Cisco']", "post_type": "Solution provided", "unique_tokens": 1500, "product_build_ids": [], "thread_id": "november_patch_tuesday_analysis_action1_4c6558", "previous_id": null, "next_id": "a479f7af-d0fc-6703-f562-a4ac938f7764", "etl_processing_status": {"document_processed": true, "entities_extracted": true, "graph_prepared": false, "vector_prepared": false, "last_processed_at": "2024-12-30T12:11:38.554428", "processing_version": "1.0"}, "build_numbers": [], "kb_ids": [], "product_mentions": [], "cve_ids": "CVE-2023-4966 CVE-2023-36033 CVE-2023-35182 CVE-2023-5731 CVE-2023-22515 CVE-2021-22569 CVE-2023-29344 CVE-2023-46604 CVE-2023-34051 CVE-2023-20198 CVE-2023-36036 CVE-2023-28285 CVE-2023-38549 CVE-2023-5044 CVE-2023-4966 CVE-2023-20273 CVE-2023-34048 CVE-2023-5482 CVE-2023-5480 CVE-2023-38547 CVE-2023-46604 CVE-2023-34056 CVE-2023-33146 CVE-2023-5044 CVE-2023-20109 CVE-2023-20252 CVE-2023-35187 CVE-2023-5043 CVE-2023-22515 CVE-2023-22514 CVE-2023-36033 CVE-2023-47246 CVE-2023-5721 CVE-2021-1435 CVE-2023-36025 CVE-2022-4886 CVE-2023-20198 CVE-2023-4966 CVE-2023-20273 CVE-2022-31706 CVE-2019-13990 CVE-2023-35182 CVE-2023-47246 CVE-2022-31704 CVE-2023-22518 CVE-2021-26084 CVE-2023-41723 CVE-2023-38548 CVE-2019-13990 CVE-2023-35185 CVE-2023-22518 CVE-2023-20273 CVE-2023-20273 CVE-2023-5730 CVE-2023-34051 CVE-2022-31711 CVE-2023-20198 CVE-2023-36036 CVE-2023-5043 CVE-2023-20048 CVE-2022-4886 CVE-2023-22515 CVE-2022-20713 CVE-2023-46604", "noun_chunks": "['Quick summary', 'Windows', 'Microsoft Exchange', 'Microsoft Access', 'Atlassian', 'Kubernetes ingress-nginx', 'Cisco']", "keywords": "['windows cloud files mini filter driver elevation', 'update rectify 387 security issue across various oracle product', 'windows smartscreen security feature bypass vulnerability cve', 'method effectively circumvent exist firewall rule', 'automate testing use tool like addresssanitizer', 'impact jira service management data center', 'announce ios xe update contain fix']", "node_label": "PatchManagementPost", "is_processed": false}, "added_at": "2024-12-30T12:19:28.118061", "last_updated": "2024-12-30T12:19:28.118061"}
