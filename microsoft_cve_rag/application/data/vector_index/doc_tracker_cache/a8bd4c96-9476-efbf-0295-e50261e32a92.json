This can mean an attack must be launched from the same shared physical (e.g., Bluetooth or IEEE 802.11) or logical (e.g., local IP subnet) network, or from within a secure or otherwise limited administrative domain (e.g., MPLS, secure VPN to an administrative network zone) \nAttack Complexity \nThis metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker\u2019s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration. \nLow \nSpecialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success against the vulnerable component. \nPrivileges Required \n \nNone \nThe attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack. \nUser Interaction \n \nRequired \nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited. \nScope \n \nUnchanged \nAn exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority. \nConfidentiality \n \nNone \nThere is no loss of confidentiality within the impacted component. \nIntegrity \n \nHigh \nThere is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component. \nAvailability \n \nNone \nThere is no impact to availability within the impacted component. \n\ue8ec \n\ue974 \nTemporal score metrics \n(3) \nExploit Code Maturity \nThis metric measures the likelihood of the vulnerability being attacked, and is typically based on the current state of exploit techniques, exploit code availability, or active, 'in-the-wild' exploitation. \nUnproven \nNo exploit code is available, or an exploit is theoretical. \nRemediation Level \n \nOfficial Fix \nA complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. \nReport Confidence \n \nConfirmed \nDetailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this). Source code is available to independently verify the assertions of the research, or the author or vendor of the affected code has confirmed the presence of the vulnerability. \nPlease see  \nCommon Vulnerability Scoring System \n for more information on the definition of these metrics. \nThe following table provides an  \nexploitability assessment \n for this vulnerability at the time of original publication. \nPublicly disclosed \nExploited \nExploitability assessment \nNo \nNo \nExploitation Less Likely \nAccording to the CVSS metric, the attack vector is adjacent (AV:A). What does that mean for this vulnerability? \nExploiting this vulnerability requires an attacker to be within proximity of the target system to send and receive radio transmissions. \nAccording to the CVSS metric, user interaction is required (UI:R). What interaction would the user have to do? \nIn order to exploit this vulnerability, the victim must pair with the attacker's Bluetooth device. \nMarc Newlin \n with  \nSkySafe \nMicrosoft recognizes the efforts of those in the security community who help us protect customers through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.
