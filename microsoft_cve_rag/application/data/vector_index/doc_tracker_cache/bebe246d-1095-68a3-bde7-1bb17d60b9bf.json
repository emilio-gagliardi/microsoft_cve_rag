You can say \u201ccorrect [text]\u201d to correct specific text. Use \u201ccorrect that\u201d to correct text you last dictated. The correction window appears with a list of words labelled with numbers. You can say \u201cclick [number]\u201d to select any word from the list. If you choose a word from the window, that word replaces the text you want to correct. You can also say \u201cspell that\u201d or \u201cspell out\u201d to dictate the correct spelling of text. You get suggestions as you spell out the text. All the words and phrases that you spell are added to the Windows dictionary.

Use your voice to dictate your password or PIN. You can say \u201cshow keyboard\u201d to bring up the touch keyboard with number labels on it. Say the number on the key to enter the letter associated with it. This will mask the password you enter from being heard by anyone in your vicinity.

Go to  \nSettings \n >  \nAccounts \n >  \nPasskeys \n. The passkey list appears.

It helps to protect school and work passwords from phishing and unsafe use on websites and in apps. This works if you have turned on the warning options for Windows Security. Go to  \nApp & browser control \n >  \nReputation-based protection \n >  \nPhishing protection \n. When it is on, a dialog appears that warns you about using a password in a way that is not safe. For example, reusing a password is not safe. \nNew! \nEnterprise customers can now set the \nEnablePasswordlessExperience policy \n. Once you set the policy, it hides passwords for some Windows authentication scenarios. This is true for signing in to a device and for in-session authentication scenarios. These include web browser password managers, \u201cRun as\u201d admin, and User Account Control (UAC). This policy applies to machines that are joined to AAD. Users can recover their passwords using a Windows Hello for Business PIN reset or by signing in on the web. They can do this without help from the IT helpdesk. \nGraphics \nNew! \nYou can turn on  \nAuto Color Management \n (ACM) on your Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) display. ACM makes all the colors on all your Windows apps appear accurately and consistently on every supported display. This is true even if the apps are not color managed. To turn ACM on, go to  \nSettings  \n>  \nDisplay  \n> \n Advanced display \n. Choose theSDR display and turn on  \nAutomatically manage color for apps \n.

ACM can provide benefits even on 8-bit sRGB panels. However, we strongly recommend ACM devices to have panels with a wider-than-sRGB gamut. Ten-bits (10-bits) per color channel or greater is also advised as an option. \nSettings \nNew! \nThis update adds a new Settings home page. It has interactive cards that represent devices and account related settings. As you use your device, the page and cards adjust to give you the most relevant and useful information. In this release, there are up to seven cards (see below).
