The originating concern indicates a failure to respect user settings, leading to unwanted upgrades and operational delays as the user seeks solutions to revert back to their previous OS without completing the Windows 11 installation.", "source_id": "6950b207-a419-d88b-a7d4-033c617e38a1", "source_type": "PatchManagementPost", "tags": ["Windows 10", "Windows 11", "Upgrade Issues"], "node_id": "0cffdc90-b301-4fc6-a246-549a2304716d", "metadata": {"node_label": "Symptom", "reliability": 0.85, "severity_type": "important", "entity_type": "Symptom"}, "added_at": "2024-12-20T15:05:30.105552", "last_updated": "2024-12-20T15:05:30.105552"}
