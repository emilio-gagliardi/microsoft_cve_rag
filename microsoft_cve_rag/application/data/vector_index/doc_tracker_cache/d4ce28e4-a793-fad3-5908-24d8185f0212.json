Goldberg Sent: Friday, December 22, 2023 6:38 AM To:\npatchmanagement@googlegroups.com Subject: RE: [patchmanagement] RE: Printer\nnames and icons might be changed and HP Smart... I ran the troubleshooter on two\nW10 Pro systems by right clicking on the file and selecting 'run as\nadministrator.' Issue was resolved on both systems (although it took about 30-40\nminutes for the icons to flip back to the original state). That said, I did not\nhave issues printing - the issue seemed to be cosmetic on my systems.
