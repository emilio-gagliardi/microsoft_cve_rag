{"symptom_label": "MaliciousOauthApplicationAccessByNewUserAccount", "description": "The creation of a new user account within the Microsoft corporate environment allows malicious OAuth applications to gain unauthorized access through the granting of consent. This behavior poses a significant risk as it provides a common user the ability to approve permissions that can affect the entire organization, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized actions being taken on behalf of the organization. There is a concern that the ability to grant consent should be disabled as it is often a critical finding during security reviews, emphasizing the need for stringent controls on user permissions.", "source_id": "5aacb359-2c31-7cb5-306b-396f3b653749", "source_type": "PatchManagementPost", "tags": ["OAuth", "UserAccountManagement", "MicrosoftEnvironment", "PermissionControl"], "node_id": "c4e5c793-a5e4-48e8-addd-c11e1a93bae6", "metadata": {"node_label": "Symptom", "reliability": 0.8, "severity_type": "important", "entity_type": "Symptom"}, "added_at": "2025-01-03T18:23:56.341187", "last_updated": "2025-01-05T08:45:08.489992"}
