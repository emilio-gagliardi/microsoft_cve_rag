If your network uses a middlebox that inspects network traffic and/or you previously encountered issues with the ZSDCH feature, review the  \nConsiderations for zstd-based Shared Dictionary Compression for HTTP \n page which contains updated guidance. \nBehavioral changes to the beforeunload event. \n The behavior of the beforeunload event has changed such that calling preventDefault in a beforeunload event handler triggers a confirmation dialog. Setting returnValue to an empty string in a beforeunload event handler no longer triggers a confirmation dialog. This behavior takes effect starting in Microsoft Edge version 119. Administrators can temporarily opt out of this functionality by disabling the  \nBeforeunloadEventCancelByPreventDefaultEnabled \n policy. \nSplit screen restore improvements. \n Split screen allows you to simultaneously work on multiple tasks across two, side-by-side screens in one browsing tab to boost your productivity and multitask more efficiently. Now after the browser is restarted and the previous session is restored, the split tab will also be restored. \nAdditional capability to manage sidebar apps. \n Administrators can utilize the \"sidebar_auto_open_blocked\"  \nExtensionSettings \n policy field to control the auto-open behavior of sidebar apps.  For more information, see  \nDetailed guide to the ExtensionSettings \n policy. \nUpdates to Microsoft Edge enterprise sync settings page. \n When the  \nForceSyncTypes \n and  \nSyncTypesListDisabled \n polices are used concurrently, the sync settings page ( \nedge://settings/profiles/sync \n) accurately show the status for each data type. \nPolicy updates \nNew policies \nSwitchIntranetSitesToWorkProfile \n - Switch intranet sites to a work profile \nSwitchSitesOnIEModeSiteListToWorkProfile \n - Switch sites on the IE mode site list to a work profile \nOrganizationalBrandingOnWorkProfileUIEnabled \n - Allow the use of your organization's branding assets from M365 on the profile-related UI of a work profile \n", "published": "2023-11-02T00:00:00", "product_build_id": "d9827433-0d76-52ad-b29d-fd400869473d", "build_number": [119, 0, 2151, 44], "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["product_build_id", "build_number", "product_build_ids", "node_label", "cve_ids", "node_id"], "article_url": "https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/DeployEdge/microsoft-edge-relnotes-security", "summary": "", "metadata": {"product_build_ids": null, "cve_ids": ["CVE-2023-5859", "CVE-2023-5858", "CVE-2023-5857", "CVE-2023-5856", "CVE-2023-5855", "CVE-2023-5854", "CVE-2023-5853", "CVE-2023-5852", "CVE-2023-5851", "CVE-2023-5850", "CVE-2023-5849", "CVE-2023-5482", "CVE-2023-5480", "CVE-2023-36034", "CVE-2023-36022"], "node_label": "KBArticle", "etl_processing_status": {"document_processed": true, "entities_extracted": false, "graph_prepared": false, "vector_prepared": false, "last_processed_at": null, "processing_version": "1.0"}}, "added_at": "2024-12-25T12:22:07.196800", "last_updated": "2024-12-26T13:15:39.068276"}
