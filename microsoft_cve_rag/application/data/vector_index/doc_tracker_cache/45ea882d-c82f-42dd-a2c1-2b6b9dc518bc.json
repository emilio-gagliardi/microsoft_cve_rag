{"symptom_label": "windows_11_policy_changes_affect_edge_configuration", "description": "A local group policy configured on a Windows 11 machine can lead to changes in the registry that affect the behavior of Microsoft Edge. This symptom manifests when a specific registry key, resulting from local policy adjustments, does not reflect the expected settings in a clean Windows 11 22H2 laptop. Users may experience unexpected behavior in Edge, including default configurations not being honored or changes not applying properly after a reboot. Administrators may notice discrepancies in settings that should govern Edge's functionality, impacting user experience positively or negatively depending on the intended configurations. This can lead to enhanced troubleshooting efforts and potential rollbacks of policies if not addressed timely.", "source_id": "c4d65f70-9ea8-2081-38ee-0affe1d405c0", "source_type": "PatchManagementPost", "tags": ["windows_11", "microsoft_edge", "local_group_policy", "registry_configuration"], "node_id": "45ea882d-c82f-42dd-a2c1-2b6b9dc518bc", "metadata": {"source_ids": ["c4d65f70-9ea8-2081-38ee-0affe1d405c0"], "node_label": "Symptom", "reliability": 0.85, "severity_type": "moderate", "entity_type": "Symptom"}, "added_at": "2025-01-06T15:49:26.425720", "last_updated": "2025-01-06T15:49:26.425720"}
