{"symptom_label": "Windows10WorkstationsFailToStartServicesPostReboot", "description": "Windows 10 workstations are experiencing issues where critical services, specifically 'lanmanworkstation' and 'netlogon', fail to start after a system reboot. This problem has been identified on three systems out of a larger fleet of approximately 500 workstations, suggesting it may be an isolated issue but potentially indicative of a wider problem if not addressed. Users can temporarily restore functionality by manually starting the affected services, but a reboot does not resolve the underlying issue, indicating a potential flaw in the system's restart process or service dependencies.", "source_id": "9faab8d0-c9b4-7f52-57ca-5f7dfb33e17f", "source_type": "PatchManagementPost", "tags": ["Windows10", "ServiceFailure", "PostReboot"], "node_id": "e45ddfb5-66da-4238-be16-566f97c40b89", "metadata": {"node_label": "Symptom", "reliability": 0.85, "severity_type": "important", "entity_type": "Symptom"}, "added_at": "2024-12-20T13:03:34.243036", "last_updated": "2024-12-20T13:03:34.243036"}
