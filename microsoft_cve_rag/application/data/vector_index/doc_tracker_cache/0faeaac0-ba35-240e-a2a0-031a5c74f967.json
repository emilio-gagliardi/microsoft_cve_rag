We have floor machines whose names are\nknown, and we replace them with new machines and name them the same as the\nincumbent. Now the helpdesk are going to have to decommission the old machine,\ndelete the account in AD, wait for the deletion to replicate, put the new\nmachine in place, rename it, join it to the domain and put it in the proper OU.\nSome of this can be done with a single PowerShell command, but it's going to\ncause problems. Worse, If I'm reading the article incorrectly (and I might be),\nI can't run a PowerShell script to take ownership of the machine accounts in AD\nfor the DAs. That seems less than ideal. This is the section of the article to\nwhich I'm referring, under \"Nonsolutions\" \"Do not manually edit the security\ndescriptor on computer accounts in an attempt to redefine the ownership of such\naccounts, unless the previous owner account has been deleted. While editing the\nowner will enable the new checks to succeed, the computer account might retain\nthe same potentially risky, unwanted permissions for the original owner unless\nexplicitly reviewed and removed.\" Kurt On Tue, Feb 13, 2024 at 5:38\u202fPM 'Susan\nBradley' via PatchManagement wrote:\nLink: None \n", "evaluated_keywords": "['already start roll', 'enterprise client']", "evaluated_noun_chunks": "['those changes', 'my enterprise clients']", "post_type": "Conversational", "unique_tokens": 17, "product_build_ids": [], "thread_id": "kb5020276netjoin_domain_join_hardening_changes", "previous_id": "1dd31186-c905-39df-2f09-6d90389f1498", "next_id": "5132a0bf-d472-e1b9-b7f4-344e38e1bf59", "etl_processing_status": {"document_processed": true, "entities_extracted": true, "graph_prepared": false, "vector_prepared": true, "last_processed_at": "2025-01-07T00:05:44.727627", "processing_version": "1.0"}, "doc_id": "0faeaac0-ba35-240e-a2a0-031a5c74f967", "noun_chunks": "['those changes', 'my enterprise clients']", "keywords": "['already start roll', 'enterprise client']", "node_label": "PatchManagementPost", "kb_ids": [], "cve_ids": "", "embedding": null, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["id", "added_to_vector_store", "added_to_summary_index", "added_to_graph_store", "cve_fixes", "cve_mentions", "email_text_original", "unique_tokens", "tags"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["id", "added_to_vector_store", "added_to_summary_index", "added_to_graph_store", "cve_fixes", "cve_mentions", "email_text_original", "unique_tokens", "tags"], "build_numbers": [], "product_mentions": [], "is_processed": false, "reliability": "", "readability": "", "extracted_symptoms": [], "extracted_causes": [], "extracted_fixes": [], "extracted_tools": [], "added_at": "2025-01-07T00:39:32.344646", "last_updated": "2025-01-07T00:39:32.344646"}
