This occurs after you install the July 9, 2024, update. This issue is more likely to occur if  \ndevice encryption \n is on. Go to  \nSettings \n >  \nPrivacy & Security \n >  \nDevice encryption \n. To unlock your drive, Windows might ask you to enter the recovery key from your Microsoft account. \n[Lock screen] \n This update addresses CVE-2024-38143. Because of this, the \u201cUse my windows user account\u201d check box is not available on the lock screen to connect to Wi-Fi. \n[NetJoinLegacyAccountReuse] \n This update removes this registry key. For more information refer to  \nKB5020276\u2014Netjoin: Domain join hardening changes \n. \n[Secure Boot Advanced Targeting (SBAT) and Linux Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI)]  \nThis update applies SBAT to systems that run Windows. This stops vulnerable Linux EFI (Shim bootloaders) from running. This SBAT update will not apply to systems that dual-boot Windows and Linux. After the SBAT update is applied, older Linux ISO images might not boot. If this occurs, work with your Linux vendor to get an updated ISO image. \nIf you installed earlier updates, only the new updates contained in this package will be downloaded and installed on your device. \nFor more information about security vulnerabilities, please refer to the  \nSecurity Update Guide \n website and the  \nAugust 2024 Security Updates \n. \nWindows 11\u00a0servicing stack update (KB5041584) - 22621.4027 and 22631.4027 \nThis update makes quality improvements to the servicing stack, which is the component that installs Windows updates. Servicing stack updates (SSU) ensure that you have a robust and reliable servicing stack so that your devices can receive and install Microsoft updates. \nKnown issues in this update \nMicrosoft is not currently aware of any issues with this update. \nHow to get this update \nBefore you install this update \nMicrosoft combines the latest servicing stack update (SSU) for your operating system with the latest cumulative update (LCU).\u00a0For general information about SSUs,\u00a0see  \nServicing stack updates \n\u00a0and\u00a0 \nServicing Stack Updates (SSU): Frequently Asked Questions \n. \nInstall this update \nTo install this update, use one of the following Windows and Microsoft release channels. \nWindows Update \nBusiness \nCatalog \nServer Update Services \nAvailable \nNext Step \nYes \nNone. This update will be downloaded and installed automatically from Windows Update and Microsoft Update. \nAvailable \nNext Step \nYes \nNone.

You can find the package name\u00a0by using this command:  \nDISM /online /get-packages \n. \nRunning  \nWindows Update Standalone Installer \n ( \nwusa.exe \n) with the  \n/uninstall  \nswitch on the combined package will not work because the combined package contains the SSU. You cannot remove the SSU from the system after installation. \nFile information \nFor a list of the files that are provided in this update, download the\u00a0 \nfile information for cumulative update 5041585 \n. \nFor a list of the files that are provided in the servicing stack update, download the\u00a0 \nfile information for the SSU (KB5041584) - versions 22621.4027 and 22631.4027 \n. \nSUBSCRIBE RSS FEEDS \n", "published": "2024-08-13T00:00:00", "product_build_id": "43304c2d-dce2-0299-d586-c54647eb90ce", "build_number": [10, 0, 22631, 4037], "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["product_build_id", "product_build_ids", "node_label", "node_id", "cve_ids", "build_number"], "article_url": "https://support.microsoft.com/help/5041585", "summary": "KB5041585 is a critical security update released on August 13, 2024, for Windows 11 version 22H2 (OS Builds 22621.4037) and version 23H2 (OS Builds 22631.4037).
