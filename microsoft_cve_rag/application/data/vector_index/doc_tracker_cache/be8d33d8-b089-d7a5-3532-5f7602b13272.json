This can mean an attack must be launched from the same shared physical (e.g., Bluetooth or IEEE 802.11) or logical (e.g., local IP subnet) network, or from within a secure or otherwise limited administrative domain (e.g., MPLS, secure VPN to an administrative network zone) \nAttack Complexity \nThis metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker\u2019s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration. \nLow \nSpecialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success against the vulnerable component. \nPrivileges Required \n \n.\n None \nThe attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack. \nUser Interaction \n \nNone \nThe vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user. \nScope \n \nUnchanged \nAn exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority. \nConfidentiality \n \nNone \nThere is no loss of confidentiality within the impacted component. \nIntegrity \n \nNone \nThere is no loss of integrity within the impacted component. \nAvailability \n \nHigh \nThere is total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). \n.\n Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable). \n\ue8ec \n\ue974 \nTemporal score metrics \n(3) \nExploit Code Maturity \nThis metric measures the likelihood of the vulnerability being attacked, and is typically based on the current state of exploit techniques, exploit code availability, or active, 'in-the-wild' exploitation. \nUnproven \nNo exploit code is available, or an exploit is theoretical. \nRemediation Level \n \nOfficial Fix \nA complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. \nReport Confidence \n \nConfirmed \nDetailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this). Source code is available to independently verify the assertions of the research, or the author or vendor of the affected code has confirmed the presence of the vulnerability. \nPlease see  \nCommon Vulnerability Scoring System \n for more information on the definition of these metrics. \n.\n The following table provides an  \nexploitability assessment \n for this vulnerability at the time of original publication. \nPublicly disclosed \nExploited \nExploitability assessment \nNo \nNo \nExploitation Less Likely \nAccording to the CVSS score, the attack vector is adjacent (AV:A). What does this mean for this vulnerability? \nThis attack is limited to systems connected to the same network segment as the attacker. The attack cannot be performed across multiple networks (for example, a WAN) and would be limited to systems on the same network switch or virtual network. \nAnonymous \nMicrosoft recognizes the efforts of those in the security community who help us protect customers through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

The vulnerability allows an attacker to cause a total loss of availability on impacted systems without requiring user interaction. The attack vector is adjacent, meaning it is limited to systems connected to the same network segment as the attacker. Microsoft has provided an official fix for this vulnerability through security updates for various Windows Server and Windows client versions, including Windows 10 and Windows 11. System administrators are advised to apply the respective security updates to mitigate the risk of exploitation. The exploit code maturity is unproven, and the remediation level is an official fix, indicating the availability of a complete vendor solution. The attack complexity is low, and the attacker does not require any privileges or user interaction to exploit the vulnerability. For more information, refer to the Microsoft Security Update Guide for specific build numbers and update details.", "impact_type": null, "severity_type": "NST", "etl_processing_status": {"document_processed": true, "nvd_extracted": true, "entities_extracted": false, "graph_prepared": false, "vector_prepared": false, "last_processed_at": "2025-01-01T12:41:51.813856", "processing_version": "1.0"}, "kb_ids": ["KB-5033379", "KB-5033375", "KB-5033372", "KB-5033369"], "cve_category": "NC", "cna_scope": "unchanged", "cwe_url": "http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/682.html", "cna_base_score": null, "adp_user_interaction": "None", "nist_privileges_required": "None", "nist_base_score_rating": "None", "cna_exploitability_score": 2.8, "adp_integrity": "None", "adp_confidentiality": "None", "adp_scope": "None", "cna_user_interaction": "none", "nist_availability": "None", "adp_attack_complexity": "None", "adp_privileges_required": "None", "nist_scope": "None", "cna_availability": "high", "cna_attack_vector": "adjacent", "nist_user_interaction": "None", "cna_integrity": "none", "nist_confidentiality": "None", "adp_base_score": null, "nvd_published_date": "2023-12-12T00:00:00", "adp_vector": null, "adp_base_score_rating": "None", "cwe_name": "Incorrect Calculation", "cwe_source": "Microsoft Corporation", "nist_base_score": null, "adp_base_score_num": null, "nist_impact_score": null, "nist_attack_complexity": "None", "adp_availability": "None", "cna_privileges_required": "none", "cna_vector": "av:a/ac:l/pr:n/ui:n/s:u/c:n/i:n/a:h", "cna_attack_complexity": "low", "nist_integrity": "None", "nist_base_score_num": null, "cna_confidentiality": "none", "adp_impact_score": null, "cna_base_score_num": 6.5, "nist_exploitability_score": null, "nist_attack_vector": "None", "adp_attack_vector": "None", "nvd_description": "internet connection sharing (ics) denial of service vulnerability", "cwe_id": "CWE-682", "cna_impact_score": 3.6, "nist_vector": null, "cna_base_score_rating": "medium", "adp_exploitability_score": null, "node_label": "MSRCPost"}, "added_at": "2025-01-01T12:56:03.456112", "last_updated": "2025-01-01T12:57:55.877100"}
