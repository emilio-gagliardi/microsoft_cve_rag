{"symptom_label": "ExternalDnsEntryCausesNetworkResolutionIssues", "description": "Improper DNS settings can lead to significant network resolution issues for systems relying on Active Directory and internal DNS services. When inexperienced technicians inadvertently include external DNS entries, such as Google DNS, it interferes with internal resource resolution, potentially causing users to experience connectivity problems to essential services. This could particularly affect Microsoft environments that depend heavily on internal DNS for authentication and resource discovery within Active Directory.", "source_id": "2633522f-c872-ddd0-7210-0a8194d67c2f", "source_type": "PatchManagementPost", "tags": ["DNS", "NetworkConfiguration", "ActiveDirectory", "Troubleshooting"], "node_id": "6d339006-6c3c-493a-b4b0-3ea47c57290a", "metadata": {"node_label": "Symptom", "reliability": 0.85, "severity_type": "moderate", "entity_type": "Symptom"}, "added_at": "2025-01-04T10:27:19.346906", "last_updated": "2025-01-05T08:56:29.753204"}
