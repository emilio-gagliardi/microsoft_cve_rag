The user can still choose to proceed by selecting \"Keep\" on the downloaded item's \"...\" menu. Admins can also use the  \nInsecureContentAllowedForUrls \n policy to specify HTTP sites where the warning will be suppressed. The warning's enablement in Edge 124 was accidental. We have reverted the warning in this Stable Release. Admins can use the  \nInsecureDownloadWarnings \n feature flag to test the impact of this upcoming feature.  \nNote: \n The warning is planned to be turned on in Microsoft Edge version 127. \nFixes \nRemoves \"Microsoft chat provider for Copilot in Windows\" from Windows Server devices. The component was incorrectly installed on some devices in a previous Microsoft Edge update. \nFeature updates \nEmail notifications for extension requests in the Microsoft Edge management service. \n The Microsoft Edge management service now provides admins with the ability to receive email notifications for extensions that their users have requested. Once enabled, this will help inform them promptly of any new pending requests that they may have. \n", "published": "2024-04-26T00:00:00", "product_build_id": "f846de0c-1bd4-997c-68d2-52fd27ce0793", "build_number": [124, 0, 2478, 67], "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["product_build_id", "build_number", "node_label", "product_build_ids", "node_id", "cve_ids"], "article_url": "https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/DeployEdge/microsoft-edge-relnotes-security", "summary": "", "metadata": {"product_build_ids": null, "cve_ids": ["CVE-2024-4060", "CVE-2024-4059", "CVE-2024-4058"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": null, "node_label": "KBArticle", "update_package_url": "", "etl_processing_status": {"document_processed": true, "entities_extracted": false, "graph_prepared": false, "vector_prepared": false, "last_processed_at": null, "processing_version": "1.0"}}, "added_at": "2025-01-13T12:32:50.197360", "last_updated": "2025-01-13T12:32:50.197360"}
