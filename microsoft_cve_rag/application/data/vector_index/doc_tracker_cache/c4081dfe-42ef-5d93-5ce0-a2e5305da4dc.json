When will an update be available to address this vulnerability? \nMicrosoft is fully aware of this issue and is actively working to release version 8.4.0 of curl.exe in a future Windows update for currently supported, on-premise versions of Windows clients and servers. The Security Updates table for this CVE will be updated with the Windows update KB numbers for all supported versions as they are released. Customers will be notified via a revision to this security vulnerability when those KB numbers are available. If you wish to be notified when these updates are released, we recommend that you register for the security notifications mailer to be alerted of content changes to this CVE. See  \nMicrosoft Technical Security Notifications \n and  \nSecurity Update Guide Notification System News: Create your profile now \u2013 Microsoft Security Response Center \n. \n2.  What is the curl open-source project? \nCurl is a computer software project providing a library (libcurl) and command-line tool (curl) for transferring data using various network protocols. The name stands for \"Client for URL\". The Windows implementation provides access to the command-line tool, not the library. \n3. \n.\n Why is this Hackerone CVE included in the Security Update Guide? \nThe vulnerability assigned to this CVE is in curl.exe software which is consumed by Microsoft Windows. It is being documented in the Security Update Guide to make customers aware that Microsoft Windows is affected by this CVE, and that Microsoft will be including the curl fix for this vulnerability in a future Windows security update. Note that we do not provide CVSS scores for non-Microsoft CVEs. See  \nNVD \n for scoring information on this CVE. \n4.  How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability? \nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to convince the victim to manually launch the curl utility and direct it to connect to a compromised server. This causes a denial of service of curl. \nFor more information see  \nHTTP headers eat all memory \n. \n5.  What version of curl addresses this CVE? \nCurl version 8.4.0 addresses this vulnerability. \n6.  Where can I find more information about this curl vulnerability? \nMore information can be found at  \nNVD \n and  \ncurl.se \n. \n7.  Are there any workarounds that can be implemented? \nIMPORTANT: Under no circumstances should you remove or replace  \ncurl.exe \n, the curl tool executable, as doing so may damage the Windows Update component store and prevent the installation of further security updates. Instead, we recommend deploying a code integrity policy that restricts the execution of vulnerable versions of  \ncurl.exe \n. \nNote that after you have implemented any of the workarounds the file will still exist on disk, and can still be detected by scanning software. The workaround only provides an operating system level guarantee that the vulnerable version of the curl tool cannot be executed. \nWorkaround \n Use a WDAC policy to deny execution of the \\system32\\curl.exe executable. You can merge the deny into an existing policy or create a new policy with it using the Merge-CIPolicy cmdlet;  \nMerge-CIPolicy (ConfigCI) | Microsoft Learn \n. After the policy XML file with the deny has been created or merged with an existing policy it must be deployed. \n.\n Choose how to deploy the policy by using one of the following methods  \nDeploying Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) policies | Microsoft Learn \n: \nDeploy using a  \nMobile Device Management (MDM)  \nsolution, such as Microsoft Intune \nDeploy using  \nMicrosoft Configuration Manager \nDeploy via  \nscript \nDeploy via  \ngroup policy \n Note that after you have deployed a code integrity policy workaround, the file will still exist on disk, and can still be detected by scanning software. The workaround only provides an operating system level guarantee that the vulnerable version of the curl tool cannot be executed. \nFor example: \nCreate a new policy: (These steps will create a new policy named Deny-Curl.xml by merging the deny using the example policy named AllowAll.xml) \n$rule = new-cipolicyrule -DriverFilePath \"$env:systemroot\\system32\\curl.exe\" -Level FilePublisher -Deny\n$rule[0].attributes[\"MinimumFileVersion\"] = \"0.0.0.0\"\n$rule[0].attributes[\"MaximumFileVersion\"] = \"8.4.0.0\" \nmerge-cipolicy \"$env:systemroot\\schemas\\CodeIntegrity\\ExamplePolicies\\AllowAll.xml\" -Rules $rule -OutputFilePath \"Deny-Curl.xml\" \nMerge into an existing policy \n$rule = new-cipolicyrule -DriverFilePath \"$env:systemroot\\system32\\curl.exe\" -Level FilePublisher -Deny\n$rule[0].attributes[\"MinimumFileVersion\"] = \"0.0.0.0\"\n$rule[0].attributes[\"MaximumFileVersion\"] = \"8.4.0.0\" \nmerge-cipolicy \"existing_policy.xml\" -Rules $rule -OutputFilePath \"existing_policy.xml\" \nHow to undo this workaround? \nGuidance for how to remove WDAC policies can be found in the following documentation:  \nRemove Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) policies \n. \nAnonymous \nHackerOne with  \nHackerOne \nMicrosoft recognizes the efforts of those in the security community who help us protect customers through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. \n.\n See  \nAcknowledgements \n for more information. \nTo determine the support lifecycle for your software, see the  \nMicrosoft Support Lifecycle \n. \n Updates \n CVSS \n\ue712 \nRelease date Descending \n\ue70f \nEdit columns \n\ue896 \nDownload \n\ue71c \nFilters \nRelease date \n\uee69 \nProduct \nPlatform \nImpact \nMax Severity \nArticle \nDownload \nBuild Number \nOct 19, 2023 \nWindows 11 Version 23H2 for x64-based Systems \n- \nDenial of Service \nLow \n5032190  \n\uf35f \nSecurity Update  \n\uf35f \n10.0.22621.2715 \nOct 19, 2023 \nWindows 11 Version 23H2 for ARM64-based Systems \n- \nDenial of Service \nLow \n5032190  \n\uf35f \nSecurity Update  \n\uf35f \n10.0.22621.2715 \nOct 19, 2023 \nCBL Mariner 2.0 x64 \n- \n- \n- \ncurl  \n\uf35f \nCBL-Mariner \n8.3.0-1 \nOct 19, 2023 \nCBL Mariner 2.0 ARM \n- \nDenial of Service \nLow \ncurl  \n\uf35f \nCBL-Mariner \n8.3.0-1 \nOct 19, 2023 \nWindows 10 Version 22H2 for 32-bit Systems \n- \nDenial of Service \nLow \n5032189  \n\uf35f \nSecurity Update  \n\uf35f \n10.0.19045.3693 \nOct 19, 2023 \nWindows 10 Version 22H2 for ARM64-based Systems \n- \nDenial of Service \nLow \n5032189  \n\uf35f \nSecurity Update  \n\uf35f \n10.0.19045.3693 \nOct 19, \n.\n 2023 \nWindows 10 Version 22H2 for x64-based Systems \n- \nDenial of Service \nLow \n5032189  \n\uf35f \nSecurity Update  \n\uf35f \n10.0.19045.3693 \nOct 19, 2023 \nWindows 11 Version 22H2 for x64-based Systems \n- \nDenial of Service \nLow \n5032190  \n\uf35f \nSecurity Update  \n\uf35f \n10.0.22621.2715 \nOct 19, 2023 \nWindows 11 Version 22H2 for ARM64-based Systems \n- \nDenial of Service \nLow \n5032190  \n\uf35f \nSecurity Update  \n\uf35f \n10.0.22621.2715 \nOct 19, 2023 \nWindows 10 Version 21H2 for x64-based Systems \n- \nDenial of Service \nLow \n5032189  \n\uf35f \nSecurity Update  \n\uf35f \n10.0.19044.3693 \nOct 19, 2023 \nWindows 10 Version 21H2 for ARM64-based Systems \n- \nDenial of Service \nLow \n5032189  \n\uf35f \nSecurity Update  \n\uf35f \n10.0.19044.3693 \nOct 19, 2023 \nWindows 10 Version 21H2 for 32-bit Systems \n- \nDenial of Service \nLow \n5032192  \n\uf35f \nSecurity Update  \n\uf35f \n10.0.22000.2600 \nOct 19, 2023 \nWindows 11 version 21H2 for ARM64-based Systems \n- \nDenial of Service \nLow \n5032192  \n\uf35f \nSecurity Update  \n\uf35f \n10.0.22000.2600 \nOct 19, 2023 \nWindows 11 version 21H2 for x64-based Systems \n- \nDenial of Service \nLow \n5032192  \n\uf35f \nSecurity Update  \n\uf35f \n10.0.22000.2600 \nOct 19, \n.\n 2023 \nWindows Server 2022 (Server Core installation) \n- \nDenial of Service \nLow \n5032198  \n\uf35f \nSecurity Update  \n\uf35f \n10.0.20348.2113 \nOct 19, 2023 \nWindows Server 2022 \n- \nDenial of Service \nLow \n5032198  \n\uf35f \nSecurity Update  \n\uf35f \n10.0.20348.2113 \nOct 19, 2023 \nWindows Server 2019 (Server Core installation) \n- \nDenial of Service \nLow \n5032196  \n\uf35f \nSecurity Update  \n\uf35f \n10.0.17763.5122 \nOct 19, 2023 \nWindows Server 2019 \n- \nDenial of Service \nLow \n5032196  \n\uf35f \nSecurity Update  \n\uf35f \n10.0.17763.5122 \nOct 19, 2023 \nWindows 10 Version 1809 for ARM64-based Systems \n- \nDenial of Service \nLow \n5032196  \n\uf35f \nSecurity Update  \n\uf35f \n10.0.17763.5122 \nOct 19, 2023 \nWindows 10 Version 1809 for x64-based Systems \n- \nDenial of Service \nLow \n5032196  \n\uf35f \nSecurity Update  \n\uf35f \n10.0.17763.5122 \nOct 19, 2023 \nWindows 10 Version 1809 for 32-bit Systems \n- \nDenial of Service \nLow \n5032196  \n\uf35f \nSecurity Update  \n\uf35f \n10.0.17763.5122 \nAll results loaded \nLoaded all 21 rows \nThe information provided in the Microsoft Knowledge Base is provided \"as is\" without warranty of any kind.
