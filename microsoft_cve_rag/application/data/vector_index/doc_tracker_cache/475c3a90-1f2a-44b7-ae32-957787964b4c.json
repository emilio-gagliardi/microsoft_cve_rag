{"tool_label": "RepairLocalGroupPolicyCache", "description": "A procedure for addressing issues related to the local group policy cache and the registry.pol file on Windows systems. The steps include deleting or renaming the registry.pol file located in 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\GroupPolicy\\Machine\\' and possibly clearing the entire content of the local group policy cache directory. This method allows the system to re-pull policy data and can resolve corrupt data store problems. Additionally, running DISM and SFC scans is recommended to repair potential system file integrity problems. These steps aim to mitigate ongoing issues with SCCM, especially in scenarios where updates may have not completed successfully.", "source_id": "c2249dc0-7a05-427f-2a8f-5883d716acac", "source_type": "PatchManagementPost", "tool_url": "https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/configmgr/", "tags": ["SCCM", "Intune", "Group Policy", "DISM", "SFC"], "node_id": "475c3a90-1f2a-44b7-ae32-957787964b4c", "metadata": {"source_url": "//groups.google.com/d/msgid/patchmanagement/0107801b296749b4852f346aba025326%40wecenergygroup.com", "node_label": "Tool", "reliability": "0.8", "severity_type": "important", "entity_type": "Tool"}, "added_at": "2024-12-31T14:22:28.488908", "last_updated": "2024-12-31T14:22:28.488908"}
