{"description": "**Fix Overview**:\n\nAs the Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE) partition continues to grow in size over time, adjusting your recovery partition size during clean installations of Windows can prevent space issues.\n\n1. For new installations of Windows 10 or Windows 11 (Pro or Home), consider setting the recovery partition size to 2 GB instead of the previous recommendation of 1 GB.\n2. Monitor the growth of the WinRE partition over time, as it has been shown to increase significantly, which may require future adjustments (potentially 3 GB) as updates roll in.\n\n**Details**:\n- This adjustment can help avoid potential complications related to space restrictions on the Windows boot partition due to the expanding WinRE partition.\n- Regularly check the used size of the WinRE partition after each major update to assess if further increases are necessary. (LLM Synthesized)\n\n**Preconditions**:\n- Ensure you are planning a clean installation of Windows 10 or 11.\n- Be aware that this recommendation may change as future updates influence partition sizes.", "source_id": "fba2a3a3-ed9f-d73b-15c8-cb5c7d2d2041", "source_type": "PatchManagementPost", "fix_label": "AdjustWindowsREPartitionSizeForFutureGrowth", "tags": ["WinRE", "Windows11", "RecoveryPartition", "LLM Synthesized"], "node_id": "30a63230-a3b5-4992-a6db-8787704d6e7b", "metadata": {"node_label": "Fix", "reliability": 0.6, "severity_type": "important", "entity_type": "Fix"}, "added_at": "2025-01-04T19:57:55.680228", "last_updated": "2025-01-04T19:57:55.680228"}
