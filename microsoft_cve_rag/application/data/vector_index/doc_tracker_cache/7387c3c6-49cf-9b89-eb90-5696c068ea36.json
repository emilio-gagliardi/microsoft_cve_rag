Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers). \nAttack Complexity \nThis metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker\u2019s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration. \nLow \nSpecialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success against the vulnerable component. \nPrivileges Required \n \nNone \nThe attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack. \nUser Interaction \n \nRequired \nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited. \nScope \n \nUnchanged \nAn exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority. \nConfidentiality \n \nNone \nThere is no loss of confidentiality within the impacted component. \nIntegrity \n \nLow \nModification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component. \nAvailability \n \nNone \nThere is no impact to availability within the impacted component. \n\ue8ec \n\ue974 \nTemporal score metrics \n(3) \nExploit Code Maturity \nThis metric measures the likelihood of the vulnerability being attacked, and is typically based on the current state of exploit techniques, exploit code availability, or active, 'in-the-wild' exploitation. \nUnproven \nNo exploit code is available, or an exploit is theoretical. \nRemediation Level \n \nOfficial Fix \nA complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. \nReport Confidence \n \nConfirmed \nDetailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this). Source code is available to independently verify the assertions of the research, or the author or vendor of the affected code has confirmed the presence of the vulnerability. \nPlease see  \nCommon Vulnerability Scoring System \n for more information on the definition of these metrics. \nThe following table provides an  \nexploitability assessment \n for this vulnerability at the time of original publication. \nPublicly disclosed \nExploited \nExploitability assessment \nNo \nNo \nExploitation Less Likely \nWhy is the severity for this CVE rated as Moderate, but the CVSS score is higher than normal? \nPer our severity guidelines \n, the amount of user interaction or preconditions required to allow this sort of exploitation downgraded the severity, specifically it says, \"If a bug requires more than a click, a key press, or several preconditions, the severity will be downgraded\". The CVSS scoring system doesn't allow for this type of nuance. \nAccording to the CVSS metric, user interaction is required (UI:R). What interaction would the user have to do? \nThe user would have to click on a specially crafted URL to be compromised by the attacker. \nAccording to the CVSS metric, successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to some loss of integrity (I:L)?

The vulnerability allows an attacker to craft a specially designed URL, which when clicked by a user, could lead to the compromise of the user's system. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could result in some loss of integrity, as the attacker can bypass the warning on the permissions message when visiting a potentially malicious website. The attack vector is through a network, with low attack complexity and no privileges required. Microsoft has provided an official fix by releasing security updates for Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) with build numbers 119.0.2151.72 and 118.0.2088.109. System administrators are advised to update their Microsoft Edge installations to the latest version to mitigate the risk of exploitation.
