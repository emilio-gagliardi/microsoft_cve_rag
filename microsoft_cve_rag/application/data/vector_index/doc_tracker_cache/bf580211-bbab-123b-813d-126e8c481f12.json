Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers). \nAttack Complexity \nThis metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker\u2019s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration. \nLow \nSpecialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success against the vulnerable component. \nPrivileges Required \n \n.\n None \nThe attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack. \nUser Interaction \n \nRequired \nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited. \nScope \n \nUnchanged \nAn exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority. \nConfidentiality \n \nHigh \nThere is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact. \nIntegrity \n \nHigh \nThere is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component. \nAvailability \n \n.\n High \nThere is total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable). \n\ue8ec \n\ue974 \nTemporal score metrics \n(3) \nExploit Code Maturity \nThis metric measures the likelihood of the vulnerability being attacked, and is typically based on the current state of exploit techniques, exploit code availability, or active, 'in-the-wild' exploitation. \nFunctional \nFunctional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists. \nRemediation Level \n \nOfficial Fix \nA complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. \nReport Confidence \n \nConfirmed \nDetailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this). \n.\n Source code is available to independently verify the assertions of the research, or the author or vendor of the affected code has confirmed the presence of the vulnerability. \nPlease see  \nCommon Vulnerability Scoring System \n for more information on the definition of these metrics. \nThe following table provides an  \nexploitability assessment \n for this vulnerability at the time of original publication. \nPublicly disclosed \nExploited \nExploitability assessment \nNo \nYes \nExploitation Detected \nWhat kind of security feature could be bypassed by successfully exploiting this vulnerability? \nThe attacker would be able to bypass Windows Defender SmartScreen checks and their associated prompts. \nAccording to the CVSS metric, user interaction is required (UI:R). What interaction would the user have to do? \nThe user would have to click on a specially crafted Internet Shortcut (.URL) or a hyperlink pointing to an Internet Shortcut file to be compromised by the attacker. \nWill Metcalf (Splunk), Microsoft Threat Intelligence, Microsoft Office Product Group Security Team \nMicrosoft recognizes the efforts of those in the security community who help us protect customers through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

"summary": "Windows SmartScreen Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability (CVE-2023-36025) has been identified with a maximum severity of 'Important'. The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass Windows Defender SmartScreen checks and associated prompts by exploiting a specially crafted Internet Shortcut (.URL) or hyperlink, requiring user interaction. The attack vector is network-based with low complexity and requires no privileges. Successful exploitation results in a total loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Microsoft has provided a complete vendor solution in the form of security updates for various Windows versions, including Windows Server 2012, 2016, 2019, and multiple Windows 10 and 11 versions. System administrators are advised to apply the relevant security updates to mitigate the risk of exploitation. For more information and specific build numbers, refer to the Microsoft Security Update Guide.", "impact_type": null, "severity_type": "NST", "etl_processing_status": {"document_processed": true, "nvd_extracted": true, "entities_extracted": false, "graph_prepared": false, "vector_prepared": false, "last_processed_at": "2024-12-30T11:58:32.517164", "processing_version": "1.0"}, "kb_ids": ["KB-5032199", "KB-5032192", "KB-5032190", "KB-5032189"], "cve_category": "NC", "nvd_published_date": "2023-11-14T00:00:00", "cna_base_score_num": 8.8, "cna_attack_complexity": "low", "adp_user_interaction": "None", "cna_user_interaction": "required", "cna_exploitability_score": 2.8, "adp_base_score": null, "nist_confidentiality": "None", "cwe_name": null, "adp_base_score_num": null, "cna_base_score": null, "cwe_id": null, "adp_integrity": "None", "nist_attack_vector": "None", "cna_integrity": "high", "cna_base_score_rating": "high", "nist_base_score_rating": "None", "nist_vector": null, "nvd_description": "windows smartscreen security feature bypass vulnerability", "adp_base_score_rating": "None", "cna_availability": "high", "cna_scope": "unchanged", "adp_impact_score": null, "cna_privileges_required": "none", "adp_confidentiality": "None", "nist_user_interaction": "None", "nist_scope": "None", "nist_exploitability_score": null, "cna_vector": "av:n/ac:l/pr:n/ui:r/s:u/c:h/i:h/a:h", "cwe_url": null, "adp_attack_vector": "None", "adp_availability": "None", "nist_privileges_required": "None", "adp_attack_complexity": "None", "nist_impact_score": null, "nist_base_score": null, "cwe_source": "None", "cna_attack_vector": "network", "cna_confidentiality": "high", "adp_privileges_required": "None", "adp_scope": "None", "nist_availability": "None", "nist_integrity": "None", "nist_base_score_num": null, "nist_attack_complexity": "None", "adp_vector": null, "adp_exploitability_score": null, "cna_impact_score": 5.9, "node_label": "MSRCPost"}, "added_at": "2024-12-30T12:17:28.298517", "last_updated": "2024-12-30T12:19:16.213362"}
