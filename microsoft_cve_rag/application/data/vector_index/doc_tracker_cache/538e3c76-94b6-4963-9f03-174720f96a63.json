{"tool_label": "VirtualMachineRCTFileManagement", "description": "This tool assists system administrators in managing RCT (Rapid Recovery) files associated with virtual machines. When existing RCT files from backups are retained, they can prevent virtual machines from starting properly. The tool's main function is to facilitate the deletion or renaming of these RCT files, ensuring a clean startup of the virtual machines. It is crucial for maintaining operational efficiency and minimizing downtime during regular business hours. This proactive management tool is especially useful for architects overseeing high availability systems.", "source_id": "0e81648c-537e-7bec-52dc-448d7babfe9a", "source_type": "PatchManagementPost", "tool_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SCCM/comments/...", "tags": ["virtual machines", "RCT management", "high availability", "backup management"], "node_id": "538e3c76-94b6-4963-9f03-174720f96a63", "metadata": {"source_url": "//groups.google.com/d/msgid/patchmanagement/...", "node_label": "Tool", "reliability": "0.6", "severity_type": "moderate", "entity_type": "Tool", "synthesized_code": null}, "added_at": "2024-12-30T14:37:55.252978", "last_updated": "2024-12-30T14:37:55.252978"}
