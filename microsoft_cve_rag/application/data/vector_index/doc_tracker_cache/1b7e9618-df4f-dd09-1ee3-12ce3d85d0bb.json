Tanium wasn\u2019t even on our list to evaluate so I\u2019ll\nadd it \ud83d\ude0a \nDidn\u2019t really get on with Ivanti, the console just looked old and tired, and\nthey seem to have just bolted on some basic Linux stuff just so they could say\n\u2018you can manage Linux as well\u2019. \nWe\u2019ve had a few demos with ManageEngine Endpoint Central and that looks pretty\ngood, nice web GUI and some neat features. We\u2019re trialling how it works across\nmultiple segregated domains at the moment and will probably go with that if it\nworks due to cost vs functionality. \nWe only need it for servers, not clients. \nClassification: BUSINESS\nLink: https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/patchmanagement/IA2PR16MB64943F362C49570667DCFA71F4442%40IA2PR16MB6494.namprd16.prod.outlook.com \n", "evaluated_keywords": "['blow rmm', 'manage workstation', 'msp world', 'add feature']", "evaluated_noun_chunks": "[\"a full-blown RMM\", \"just a subset\", \"the MSP world\", \"The company\"]", "post_type": "Conversational", "unique_tokens": 53, "product_build_ids": [], "thread_id": "ivanti", "previous_id": "2154242e-d0db-d8de-f443-5aed29151212", "next_id": "f7a7d74a-0819-4c39-1191-2a6cb4d2896e", "etl_processing_status": {"document_processed": true, "entities_extracted": false, "graph_prepared": false, "vector_prepared": false, "last_processed_at": "2025-01-06T21:51:51.762240+00:00", "processing_version": "1.0"}, "noun_chunks": "[\"a full-blown RMM\", \"just a subset\", \"the MSP world\", \"The company\"]", "keywords": "['blow rmm', 'manage workstation', 'msp world', 'add feature']", "node_label": "PatchManagementPost", "kb_ids": [], "cve_ids": "", "build_numbers": [], "product_mentions": [], "is_processed": false}, "added_at": "2025-01-06T15:48:15.325191", "last_updated": "2025-01-06T15:59:12.147884"}
