Thank you for sharing your knowledge,\nadvice and most of all, your time.\u00a0 I can't imagine being able to do half of\nwhat I did without this great resource. \nMerry Christmas to those of you that choose to celebrate this and best wishes to\neveryone. \nMay patch Tuesdays be calm and all your systems run smoothly over the coming\nyears. \nTake care and so long. \nGlen. \n--\nLink: https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/patchmanagement/ed9994bfa08d47beb18c77d61eba2317%40MPECSInc.Ca \n", "evaluated_keywords": "['merry christmas', 'many blessing', 'regular business hour', 'monday thru friday']", "evaluated_noun_chunks": "['Merry Christmas too you', 'many blessings', 'your retirement', 'our regular business hours']", "post_type": "Conversational", "unique_tokens": 64, "product_build_ids": [], "cve_ids": null, "etl_processing_status": {"document_processed": true, "entities_extracted": true, "graph_prepared": true, "vector_prepared": true, "last_processed_at": "2025-01-01T20:22:58.208810", "processing_version": "1.0"}, "is_processed": true, "next_id": "a8e1a0a4-6338-c314-2baa-7f0100337ade", "previous_id": "a1492fd8-c424-f20d-81e3-730c4fea7d1a", "product_mentions": [], "thread_id": "ntsysadmin_thanks_merry_christmas_llong", "noun_chunks": "['Merry Christmas too you', 'many blessings', 'your retirement', 'our regular business hours']", "keywords": "['merry christmas', 'many blessing', 'regular business hour', 'monday thru friday']", "node_label": "PatchManagementPost", "kb_ids": [], "build_numbers": []}, "added_at": "2025-01-01T18:04:10.107125", "last_updated": "2025-01-01T20:31:29.686030"}
