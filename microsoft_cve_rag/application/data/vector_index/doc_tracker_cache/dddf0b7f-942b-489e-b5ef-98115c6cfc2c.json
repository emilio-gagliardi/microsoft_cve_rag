This can be beneficial in environments with strict network policies or in need of offline installation capabilities. Users can utilize the provided link for a direct download of the full version. Detailed instructions and support can be found in the documentation provided by Adobe.", "source_id": "eeee9c20-768c-ea59-fab2-65d08100ecaa", "source_type": "PatchManagementPost", "tool_url": "https://get.adobe.com/reader/enterprise/", "tags": ["Adobe", "AcrobatReader", "installer", "enterprise"], "node_id": "dddf0b7f-942b-489e-b5ef-98115c6cfc2c", "metadata": {"source_url": "//groups.google.com/d/msgid/patchmanagement/...", "node_label": "Tool", "reliability": "0.9", "severity_type": "important", "entity_type": "Tool", "synthesized_code": null}, "added_at": "2024-12-30T15:45:02.756434", "last_updated": "2024-12-30T15:45:02.756434"}
