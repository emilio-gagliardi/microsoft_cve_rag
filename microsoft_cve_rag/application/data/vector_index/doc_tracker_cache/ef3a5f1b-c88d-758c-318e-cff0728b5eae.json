On your\nWindows 11 I'll bet BOTH recovery partitions are not in use. \n[cid:image004.png@01DA49AF.FC1ACC10] \nMy actual recovery partition in use is number 4 \n[cid:image005.png@01DA49AF.FC1ACC10] \nSo step one - which partition - if any - is in use?\u00a0 reagentc /info is your\nfriend \nStep two use minitool partition wizard free to see how REALLY free that\npartition is and what are your options for resizing\nLink: https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/patchmanagement/DS0PR10MB7341A8A37EE5C80A1A4023629E712%40DS0PR10MB7341.namprd10.prod.outlook.com \n", "evaluated_keywords": "['indicate something abnormal occur', 'device normally show 4 option', 'two partition list reagentc', 'showing disk management \\u2019']", "evaluated_noun_chunks": "[\"Jim\u2019s Disk Management pic\", \"his Win10 device\", \"Only two partitions\", \"the Recovery partition\"]", "post_type": "Conversational", "unique_tokens": 155, "product_build_ids": [], "cve_ids": null, "etl_processing_status": {"document_processed": true, "entities_extracted": true, "graph_prepared": true, "vector_prepared": true, "last_processed_at": "2025-01-03T16:42:10.854928", "processing_version": "1.0"}, "is_processed": true, "next_id": "c9aa8ea0-2672-d956-5e8a-f5c7c6625b5a", "previous_id": "7efe0285-cf19-c14a-d906-92a5801c259f", "product_mentions": [], "thread_id": "feedback_microsoft", "build_numbers": [], "kb_ids": [], "noun_chunks": "[\"Jim\u2019s Disk Management pic\", \"his Win10 device\", \"Only two partitions\", \"the Recovery partition\"]", "keywords": "['indicate something abnormal occur', 'device normally show 4 option', 'two partition list reagentc', 'showing disk management \\u2019']", "node_label": "PatchManagementPost"}, "added_at": "2025-01-03T16:36:03.961187", "last_updated": "2025-01-04T21:08:01.631874"}
