Do\nnot click links or open attachments unless you recognize the sender and know the\ncontent is safe \nHi \nMS announced that Classic Teams users will be updated to new Teams after March\n2024, but looks like MS are pushing early as some of our users had the \"forced\"\nscreen recently and looking at other forums a few others have been forced over\ntoo over the last month. Some of our users (including myself) who have had the\nupdate have seen a number of bugs in the new version Teams. We have had to\nswitch back to classic due to crashing issues and the concern is this may become\na wider issue to our end-user community as Teams is not managed as part of the\nM365 update but rather \"MS controlled\" through Teams Admin with limited\noptions. \nI'm wondering if anyone else has seen this issue and how have you addressed it\nwithin your org? Did you send any comms to end-users to notify them of the new\nupdate and the option to switch back to classic if they experience any issues? \nNot even sure why MS couldn't allow IT admins the ability to deploy Teams\nupdates through any delivery mechanism in the same way for M365 apps! \nThanks, \nAmag \n--\nLink: https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/patchmanagement/DBBP189MB1340EBD048E8A6FAD37AE527E96C2%40DBBP189MB1340.EURP189.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM \n", "evaluated_keywords": "['push use ms teams policy', 'new ms teams client', 'user lack permission', 'centrally update']", "evaluated_noun_chunks": "['the updates', 'MS Teams policy', 'the new client', 'Early adopters']", "post_type": "Solution provided", "unique_tokens": 85, "thread_id": "forcing_classic_teams_users_new_teams", "previous_id": "93eb25e1-c886-ed71-252c-77f526d2d9fe", "next_id": "43ddecd4-90ce-d203-4925-6accfc2c4cc3", "etl_processing_status": {"document_processed": true, "entities_extracted": false, "graph_prepared": false, "vector_prepared": false, "last_processed_at": "2025-01-03T23:16:23.435928+00:00", "processing_version": "1.0"}, "build_numbers": [], "kb_ids": [], "product_mentions": [], "cve_ids": "", "noun_chunks": "['the updates', 'MS Teams policy', 'the new client', 'Early adopters']", "keywords": "['push use ms teams policy', 'new ms teams client', 'user lack permission', 'centrally update']", "node_label": "PatchManagementPost", "is_processed": false}, "added_at": "2025-01-03T16:35:13.270840", "last_updated": "2025-01-03T16:40:19.172988"}
