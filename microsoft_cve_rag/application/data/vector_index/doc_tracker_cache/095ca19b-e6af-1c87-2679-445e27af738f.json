Either: the attacker exploits the vulnerability by accessing the target system locally (e.g., keyboard, console), or remotely (e.g., SSH); or the attacker relies on User Interaction by another person to perform actions required to exploit the vulnerability (e.g., tricking a legitimate user into opening a malicious document) \nAttack Complexity \nThis metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker\u2019s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration. \nHigh \nA successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected. For example, a successful attack may require an attacker to: gather knowledge about the environment in which the vulnerable target/component exists; prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability; or inject themselves into the logical network path between the target and the resource requested by the victim in order to read and/or modify network communications (e.g., a man in the middle attack). \nPrivileges Required \n \nNone \nThe attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack. \nUser Interaction \n \nRequired \nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited. \nScope \n \nChanged \nAn exploited vulnerability can affect resources beyond the security scope managed by the security authority of the vulnerable component. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are different and managed by different security authorities. \nConfidentiality \n \nLow \nThere is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component. \nIntegrity \n \nLow \nModification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component. \nAvailability \n \nLow \nPerformance is reduced or there are interruptions in resource availability. Even if repeated exploitation of the vulnerability is possible, the attacker does not have the ability to completely deny service to legitimate users. The resources in the impacted component are either partially available all of the time, or fully available only some of the time, but overall there is no direct, serious consequence to the impacted component. \n\ue8ec \n\ue974 \nTemporal score metrics \n(3) \nExploit Code Maturity \nThis metric measures the likelihood of the vulnerability being attacked, and is typically based on the current state of exploit techniques, exploit code availability, or active, 'in-the-wild' exploitation. \nUnproven \nNo exploit code is available, or an exploit is theoretical. \nRemediation Level \n \nOfficial Fix \nA complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. \nReport Confidence \n \nConfirmed \nDetailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this). Source code is available to independently verify the assertions of the research, or the author or vendor of the affected code has confirmed the presence of the vulnerability. \nPlease see  \nCommon Vulnerability Scoring System \n for more information on the definition of these metrics. \nThe following table provides an  \nexploitability assessment \n for this vulnerability at the time of original publication. \nPublicly disclosed \nExploited \nExploitability assessment \nNo \nNo \nExploitation Less Likely \nAccording to the CVSS metric, the attack vector is local (AV:L) and user interaction is required (UI:R), what does that mean for this vulnerability? \nThe attack itself is carried out locally. For example, when the score indicates that the  \nAttack Vector \n is  \nLocal \n and  \nUser Interaction \n is  \nRequired \n, this could describe an exploit in which an attacker, through social engineering, convinces a victim to click on a local file path link or download and run a malicious application or file. \nAccording to the CVSS metric, a successful exploitation could lead to a scope change (S:C). What does this mean for this vulnerability? \nThis vulnerability could lead to a browser sandbox escape. \nAccording to the CVSS metric, the attack complexity is high (AC:H). What does that mean for this vulnerability? \nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability requires an attacker to take additional actions prior to exploitation to prepare the target environment. \nAccording to the CVSS metrics, successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to minor loss of confidentiality (C:L), integrity (I:L) and availability (A:L). What does that mean for this vulnerability? \nWhile we cannot rule out the impact to Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability, the ability to exploit this vulnerability by itself is limited.
