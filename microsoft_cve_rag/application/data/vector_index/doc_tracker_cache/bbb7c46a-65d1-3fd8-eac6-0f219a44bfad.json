I\u2019ve found that a lot of our HP and Xerox printers are using LDAP. Same for a web content filter from Barracuda. So for those their product either needs to support the new binding OR we would need to have a certificate from the domain for LDAPS for those to work, correct? From what I can also tell when searching the event viewer on all domain controllers I see no workstations or servers which are using LDAP, most likely because they are all Win10, Server 2012/2016. Because by default those will try to use the new binding correct? 1 - Do I need to change software that connects via LDAP to DCs eg McAfee ePo ? is it require LDAP \u2013 Requires new signing capabilities ? So ,they may break if they don\u2019t support the new signing ? 2 - Also , lets say , if they don\u2019t support the new signing then I have to switch to LDAP/S ? 3- Already newer cumulative update is installed on all domain controllers. If the LdapEnforceChannelBinding key is not present, the server will use the new default value of 2 (enforced) after the patch with the LDAP changes is applied.
