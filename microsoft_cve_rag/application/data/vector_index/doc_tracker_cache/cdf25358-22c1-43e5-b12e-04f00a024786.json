{"symptom_label": "WindowsUpdateHistoryNotReflectingInstalledPatches", "description": "Windows 11 23H2 Pro and Home devices experience an issue where KB5034234, associated with SafeOS DU, is not recorded in the update history, event viewer, or in the list of installed updates. Despite being included with recent cumulative updates such as KB5034123 (build 22621 - 22631), the availability of file versioning information does not consistently reflect the expected installed versions after the updates are applied. This lack of transparency can lead users to uncertainty about the successful application of critical updates and recovery processes, particularly as the event viewer only acknowledges the cumulative update's involvement without explicit mentions of KB5034234's operations.", "source_id": "f1d77c36-0b1a-038c-a364-02ac215ac1f8", "source_type": "PatchManagementPost", "tags": ["WindowsUpdate", "PatchManagement", "Windows11", "CumulativeUpdate"], "node_id": "cdf25358-22c1-43e5-b12e-04f00a024786", "metadata": {"node_label": "Symptom", "reliability": 0.85, "severity_type": "moderate", "entity_type": "Symptom"}, "added_at": "2025-01-03T18:23:53.894686", "last_updated": "2025-01-05T08:45:07.120398"}
