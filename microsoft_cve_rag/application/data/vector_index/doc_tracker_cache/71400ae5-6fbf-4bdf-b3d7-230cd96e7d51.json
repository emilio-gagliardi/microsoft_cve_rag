{"tool_label": "DisableSpoolerService", "description": "This is a procedural guideline for disabling the Print Spooler service as a mitigative measure against potential exploitation from vulnerabilities. The Print Spooler service allows printing jobs to be queued and managed, but it has been targeted for exploitation in various security scenarios. By disabling this service, you limit the attack surface associated with print-related vulnerabilities, particularly when they can be exploited over the network. Users should ensure that no applications or services rely on the Print Spooler being active. Administrators may use services.msc or corresponding PowerShell commands to manage the service status. The detailed explanation for this Tool is provided in the Fix description.", "source_id": "6325eb14-9158-b179-a748-984496a593ba", "source_type": "PatchManagementPost", "tool_url": "N/A", "tags": ["PrintSpooler", "security", "mitigation", "LLM Synthesized"], "node_id": "71400ae5-6fbf-4bdf-b3d7-230cd96e7d51", "metadata": {"source_url": "N/A", "node_label": "Tool", "reliability": 0.6, "severity_type": "important", "entity_type": "Tool", "source_ids": ["6325eb14-9158-b179-a748-984496a593ba"]}, "added_at": "2025-01-06T15:52:24.942345", "last_updated": "2025-01-06T15:52:24.942345"}
