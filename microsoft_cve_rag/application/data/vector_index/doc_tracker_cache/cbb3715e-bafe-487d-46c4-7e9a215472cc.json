This can mean an attack must be launched from the same shared physical (e.g., Bluetooth or IEEE 802.11) or logical (e.g., local IP subnet) network, or from within a secure or otherwise limited administrative domain (e.g., MPLS, secure VPN to an administrative network zone) \nAttack Complexity \nThis metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker\u2019s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration. \nLow \nSpecialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success against the vulnerable component. \nPrivileges Required \n \n.\n Low \nThe attacker is authorized with (i.e., requires) privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges may have the ability to cause an impact only to non-sensitive resources. \nUser Interaction \n \nNone \nThe vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user. \nScope \n \nChanged \nAn exploited vulnerability can affect resources beyond the security scope managed by the security authority of the vulnerable component. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are different and managed by different security authorities. \nConfidentiality \n \nHigh \nThere is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact. \nIntegrity \n \nHigh \nThere is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component. \nAvailability \nThis metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). \n.\n Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component. \nHigh \nThere is total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable). \n\ue8ec \n\ue974 \nTemporal score metrics \n(3) \nExploit Code Maturity \nThis metric measures the likelihood of the vulnerability being attacked, and is typically based on the current state of exploit techniques, exploit code availability, or active, 'in-the-wild' exploitation. \nUnproven \nNo exploit code is available, or an exploit is theoretical. \nRemediation Level \n \nOfficial Fix \nA complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. \nReport Confidence \nThis metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. \n.\n This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers. \nConfirmed \nDetailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this). Source code is available to independently verify the assertions of the research, or the author or vendor of the affected code has confirmed the presence of the vulnerability. \nPlease see  \nCommon Vulnerability Scoring System \n for more information on the definition of these metrics. \nThe following table provides an  \nexploitability assessment \n for this vulnerability at the time of original publication. \nPublicly disclosed \nExploited \nExploitability assessment \nNo \nNo \nExploitation More Likely \nWhat kind of security feature could be bypassed by successfully exploiting this vulnerability? \nThe authentication feature could be bypassed as this vulnerability allows impersonation. \nHow could an attacker exploit this vulnerability? \nAn authenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by establishing a machine-in-the-middle (MITM) attack or other local network spoofing technique, then sending a malicious Kerberos message to the client victim machine to spoof itself as the Kerberos authentication server. \nAccording to the CVSS metric, the attack vector is adjacent (AV:A). What does that mean for this vulnerability? \nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability requires that an attacker will need to first gain access to the restricted network before running an attack. \nAccording to the CVSS metric, a successful exploitation could lead to a scope change (S:C). What does this mean for this vulnerability? \nAn exploited vulnerability can affect resources beyond the security scope managed by the security authority of the vulnerable component. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are different and managed by different security authorities. \nldwilmore34 \nMicrosoft recognizes the efforts of those in the security community who help us protect customers through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

"summary": "Windows Kerberos Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability, identified as CVE-2024-20674, has been classified as Critical. The vulnerability allows impersonation by bypassing the authentication feature, potentially leading to a total loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by establishing a machine-in-the-middle (MITM) attack or local network spoofing, then sending a malicious Kerberos message to spoof itself as the Kerberos authentication server. The attack vector is adjacent, requiring the attacker to gain access to the restricted network before running an attack. Microsoft has provided a complete vendor solution, with security updates released for various Windows versions including Windows Server 2012, 2016, 2008, and Windows 10, addressing the Security Feature Bypass vulnerability. System administrators are advised to apply the security updates to mitigate the risk of exploitation and protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of their systems.", "impact_type": null, "severity_type": "critical", "adp_attack_complexity": null, "adp_attack_vector": null, "adp_availability": null, "adp_base_score": null, "adp_base_score_num": null, "adp_base_score_rating": null, "adp_confidentiality": null, "adp_exploitability_score": null, "adp_impact_score": null, "adp_integrity": null, "adp_privileges_required": null, "adp_scope": null, "adp_user_interaction": null, "adp_vector": null, "cna_attack_complexity": "low", "cna_attack_vector": "network", "cna_availability": "high", "cna_base_score": null, "cna_base_score_num": 8.8, "cna_base_score_rating": "high", "cna_confidentiality": "high", "cna_exploitability_score": 2.8, "cna_impact_score": 5.9, "cna_integrity": "high", "cna_privileges_required": null, "cna_scope": "unchanged", "cna_user_interaction": "required", "cna_vector": "av:n/ac:l/pr:n/ui:r/s:u/c:h/i:h/a:h", "cve_category": "feature_bypass", "cwe_id": "CWE-290; CWE-305", "cwe_name": "Authentication Bypass by Spoofing; Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness", "cwe_source": "NIST; Microsoft Corporation", "cwe_url": "http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/290.html; http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/305.html", "etl_processing_status": {"document_processed": true, "nvd_extracted": true, "entities_extracted": true, "graph_prepared": true, "vector_prepared": true, "last_processed_at": "2025-01-02T12:19:40.019124", "processing_version": "1.0"}, "nist_attack_complexity": null, "nist_attack_vector": null, "nist_availability": null, "nist_base_score": null, "nist_base_score_num": null, "nist_base_score_rating": null, "nist_confidentiality": null, "nist_exploitability_score": null, "nist_impact_score": null, "nist_integrity": null, "nist_privileges_required": null, "nist_scope": null, "nist_user_interaction": null, "nist_vector": null, "nvd_description": "windows kerberos security feature bypass vulnerability", "nvd_published_date": "2024-01-09T00:00:00", "id_": null, "kb_ids": ["KB-5034134", "KB-5034123", "KB-5034122", "KB-5034121"], "node_label": "MSRCPost"}, "added_at": "2025-01-01T23:19:39.160987", "last_updated": "2025-01-02T18:44:37.561141"}
