In this case, having only 300 MB of free space on a 750 MB recovery partition is inadequate. This can lead to difficulties in executing system updates or recovery operations, highlighting a potential issue for system administrators managing recovery partitions in environments running Windows-based systems.", "source_id": "dedf148b-1a10-27f1-4c46-5d4e00ade310", "source_type": "PatchManagementPost", "tags": ["recovery partition", "free space", "sysadmin tools", "system updates"], "node_id": "37021033-1bd2-4144-bd2c-916b8817c42e", "metadata": {"source_ids": null, "node_label": "Symptom", "reliability": 0.85, "severity_type": "moderate", "entity_type": "Symptom"}, "added_at": "2025-01-03T14:44:06.513411", "last_updated": "2025-01-04T19:54:26.301094"}
