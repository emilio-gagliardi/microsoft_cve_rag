Servicing stack updates (SSU) ensure that you have a robust and reliable servicing stack so that your devices can receive and install Microsoft updates. \nKnown issues in this update \nApplies to \nSymptom \nWorkaround \nIT admins \nUsing the  \nFixedDrivesEncryptionType \n or  \nSystemDrivesEncryptionType \n policy settings in the  \nBitLocker configuration service provider (CSP) \n node in mobile device management (MDM) apps might incorrectly show a 65000 error in the \"Require Device Encryption\" setting for some devices in your environment. Affected environments are those with the \u201cEnforce drive encryption type on operating system drives\u201d or \"Enforce drive encryption on fixed drives\" policies set to enabled and selecting either \"full encryption\" or \"used space only\". Microsoft Intune is affected by this issue but third-party MDMs might also pe affected. \nImportant \n This issue is a reporting issue only and does not affect drive encryption or the reporting of other issues on the device, including other BitLocker issues. \nThis issue is addressed in  \nKB5034121 \n. \nHow to get this update \nBefore installing this update \nMicrosoft combines the latest servicing stack update (SSU) for your operating system with the latest cumulative update (LCU).\u00a0For general information about SSUs,\u00a0see  \nServicing stack updates \n\u00a0and\u00a0 \nServicing Stack Updates (SSU): Frequently Asked Questions \n. \nInstall this update \nRelease Channel \nAvailable \nNext Step \nWindows Update and Microsoft Update \nYes \nNone.
