Among these,\nthere are four critical vulnerabilities that have been addressed, marking a\nslight increase from the previous month. Notably, the only vulnerability with a\nProof of Concept (PoC) this month is specifically related to AMD chipsets. While\nDecember brings a welcome pause from zero-day vulnerabilities, it\u2019s crucial to\nremember that hackers often intensify their efforts during the holidays, so it\u2019s\nessential to secure your systems and endpoints before the holiday season begins.\nThis proactive approach will help you enjoy the holidays without concerns about\ncybersecurity. Let\u2019s dive into the details of the most significant critical\nupdates from this month\u2019s release. \nMicrosoft Access \nAcros Security developers have stepped up to address a significant issue in\nMicrosoft Access. \nOn November 9, 2023, Check Point Research researchers revealed an information\ndisclosure vulnerability in Microsoft Access. This flaw allows attackers to\nobtain a victim\u2019s NTLM hash. It occurs when the victim opens a Microsoft Office\ndocument embedded with an Access database linked to a remote SQL Server database\nusing \u201cWindows NT authentication.\u201d This forces authentication, thus leaking the\nNTLM hash each time Access updates a table with this link. Unlike typical forced\nauthentication problems, this one uses SQL Server port 1433 instead of SMB and\nRPC, with the ability to use any port, including firewall-friendly ports 80 or\n443. Haifei researchers proposed an AutoExec macro solution to automatically\nopen a table and prompt an update, circumventing these issues. \nCheck Point initially reported this vulnerability to Microsoft in January 2023.\nHowever, by July, they had not received a definitive response, as the issue was\ndeemed \u201clow/no severity\u201d by the MSRC. Although Access began showing a security\ndialog box when opening a Proof of Concept (PoC) file, closing this dialog still\ntriggered AutoExec, sending credentials to the attacker\u2019s server. The only\nsolution to prevent this exploit is to forcibly terminate the msaccess.exe\nprocess. Over recent years, Microsoft has addressed some vulnerabilities but\nignored others, such as DFSCoerce, PrinterBug/SpoolSample, and PetitPotam.\nRemotePotato0 and ShadowCoerce were initially ignored too but were discreetly\npatched 9 and 6 months after their discovery, respectively. In contrast, a\nsimilar WordPad vulnerability was openly patched by Microsoft just last month. \nIn conclusion, the researchers believe Microsoft has no plans to rectify this\nAccess issue, a stance they find problematic given its similarity in impact to\nthe WordPad vulnerability. While Microsoft\u2019s response remains uncertain, 0patch\nhas taken the initiative, releasing a micropatch for Microsoft Office to\nmitigate this security risk. \nGoogle Chrome \nGoogle is responding to a significant cybersecurity threat with an emergency\nupdate aimed at addressing the sixth zero-day vulnerability discovered in Chrome\nthis year. This vulnerability, actively exploited in real-world attacks, is one\nof seven critical issues currently being patched. \nThe primary concern is CVE-2023-6345, an integer overflow issue in the Skia 2D\ngraphics library, an open-source project. This flaw can lead to a range of\nproblems, from Denial of Service (DoS) to Remote Code Execution (RCE). It allows\nremote attackers to bypass Chrome\u2019s sandbox protections via a specially crafted\nHTML page, potentially after compromising the renderer process. This\nvulnerability was identified last Friday by Google TAG researchers, who focus on\nspyware and Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) activity. \nInterestingly, this isn\u2019t the first time Google has addressed a similar issue.\nIn April 2023, they patched another integer overflow vulnerability\n(CVE-2023-2136) in Skia. Given that the previous flaw was also exploited as a\nzero-day, CVE-2023-6345 might represent a method to circumvent that earlier\npatch. \nThe other vulnerabilities addressed in this update include: \n* CVE-2023-6348: A type confusion issue in Spellcheck, reported by Mark Brand\n of Google Project Zero on October 23, 2023.\n * CVE-2023-6347: A use-after-free error in Mojo, reported by Leecraso and Guang\n Gong of the 360 Vulnerability Research Institute on October 21, 2023.\n * CVE-2023-6346: A use-after-free error in WebAudio, reported by Huang Xilin of\n Ant Group Light-Year Security Lab on November 9, 2023.\n * CVE-2023-6350: An out-of-bounds memory access in libavif, reported by Fudan\n University on November 13, 2023.\n * CVE-2023-6351: Another use-after-free error in libavif, also reported by\n Fudan University. \nGoogle has withheld detailed information on these vulnerabilities and their\nexploitation, pending the complete rollout of the updates. These updates are\navailable for Windows (version 119.0.6045.199/.200) and Mac and Linux (version\n119.0.6045.199). \nMozilla Firefox \nMozilla\u2019s latest release, Firefox 119, not only brings new features and bug\nfixes but also includes 25 security updates. Of these, 17 vulnerabilities,\nprimarily grouped under CVE-2023-5730 and CVE-2023-5731, are classified as\ndangerous due to memory-related issues. These include buffer overflows and\naccessing previously freed memory areas, which could potentially enable an\nattacker to execute code when specific, specially crafted web pages are\naccessed. \nAdditionally, a separate critical vulnerability, identified as CVE-2023-5721,\nposes a risk by allowing clickjacking. This vulnerability could be exploited to\nmanipulate users into inadvertently confirming or canceling certain browser\ndialogues or warnings. \nWordPress \nA significant security concern has emerged for users of the WP Fastest Cache\nplugin, which is widely used on WordPress sites. This plugin, installed on over\n1 million websites, is designed to enhance page load times, boost visitor\ninteraction, and improve Google search rankings. However, a SQL vulnerability in\nthe plugin puts more than 600,000 websites at risk, as revealed by the WPScan\nteam at Automattic. This vulnerability, identified as CVE-2023-6063 and rated\nwith a severity of 8.6, affects versions of the plugin dating back to 1.2.2. It\nstems from an issue in the is_user_admin function of the\nWpFastestCacheCreateCache class, where the $username input from cookies is\nimproperly sanitized. This oversight allows unauthenticated attackers to\nmanipulate the SQL query, gaining access to the site\u2019s database, which often\ncontains sensitive user data, passwords, and site configurations. With its\npotential for easy exploitation, the urgency for users to update to the latest\nplugin version, 1.2.2, cannot be overstated. \nAdditionally, WordPress\u2019s release of update 6.4.2 addresses another critical\nvulnerability. Discovered by Wordfence, this vulnerability involves a\nproperty-oriented programming (POP) chain in the WP_HTML_Token class, introduced\nin WordPress 6.4. Under certain conditions, it could allow attackers to execute\narbitrary PHP code on vulnerable sites. The POP chain vulnerability is\nparticularly concerning because it enables attackers to hijack application flow\nand potentially take control of a site. However, exploiting this vulnerability\nrequires control over all properties of a deserialized object, achievable via\nthe PHP unserialize() function. Although this vulnerability is not critical on\nits own, it becomes significantly more dangerous when combined with a PHP object\ninjection vulnerability in a plugin or theme add-on. \nThe exploit chain, already available on GitHub and added to the PHP Generic\nGadget Chains (PHPGGC) project, heightens the risk. Patchstack advises users to\nmanually check their websites and update to the latest WordPress version. They\nalso recommend replacing any calls to the unserialize function with safer\nalternatives like json_encode and json_decode. \nIn summary, while both vulnerabilities pose critical risks under certain\nconditions, the recommended course of action is for administrators to promptly\nupgrade to the latest versions of both the WP Fastest Cache plugin and\nWordPress. \nWordPress users have been alerted to a critical Remote Code Execution (RCE)\nvulnerability in the Backup Migration plugin, identified as CVE-2023-6553 and\nrated with a CVSS score of 9.8. This severe vulnerability permits\nunauthenticated attackers to hijack target websites by executing remote code\nthrough PHP injection. The specific point of exploit is found in the file\n/includes/backup-heart.php. \nThis critical bug was first identified by the Nex Team, who promptly reported\ntheir findings to Wordfence. Wordfence then quickly communicated the issue to\nthe developers of the Backup Migration plugin. The vulnerability impacts all\nplugin versions up to and including Backup Migration 1.3.6 and can be exploited\nwithout any user interaction. Despite the swift release of a patch to address\nthis issue, an estimated 50,000 WordPress sites using this plugin remain\nvulnerable. \nAs a precautionary measure, experts are urging users to immediately update the\nBackup Migration plugin. In addition to this, they recommend backing up site\ndata and changing WordPress login credentials to further secure their websites\nagainst potential exploits. \nWeb Password Managers \nRecent research conducted by experts at the Indian Institute of Technology in\nHyderabad has uncovered a significant vulnerability in several widely-used\nAndroid password managers. This vulnerability, known as AutoSpill, poses a\nserious threat as it allows attackers to access user credentials. The\nvulnerability becomes exploitable when users employ the AutoFill password\nfeature in conjunction with WebView. \nIn their investigation, the researchers tested AutoSpill against popular\npassword managers like 1Password, LastPass, Keeper, and Enpass. They discovered\nthat most of these applications were still vulnerable, even when JavaScript\ninjection protection was active. Notably, all the password managers tested\nshowed vulnerabilities when JavaScript was enabled, and the research was\nconducted on the latest versions of Android. \nThe severity of this finding cannot be overstated, given that password managers\nare expected to be among the most secure applications. The developers of these\npassword managers have been informed about the issues and are currently working\non fixes. However, in light of these findings, the researchers advise users to\nexercise caution. As a temporary measure, it is recommended to avoid using these\npassword management applications until the vulnerabilities are fully addressed. \nAtlassian \nAtlassian has announced the release of patches for four critical vulnerabilities\nin its software suite, addressing flaws that could potentially lead to Remote\nCode Execution (RCE) if exploited. \nThe vulnerabilities are as follows: \n* CVE-2022-1471 (CVSS score: 9.8): This is a deserialization vulnerability\n found in the SnakeYAML library, affecting multiple Atlassian products. It\n poses a high risk of remote code execution.\n * CVE-2023-22522 (CVSS score: 9.0): This vulnerability affects all versions of\n Confluence Data Center and Confluence Server, including 4.0.0 and later.\n Atlassian has identified it as a pattern injection vulnerability, which\n allows even an anonymous attacker to execute code by manipulating insecure\n user input on a Confluence page.\n * CVE-2023-22523 (CVSS score: 9.8): Found in Assets Discovery for Jira Service\n Management Cloud, Server, and Data Center, this vulnerability affects all\n versions up to and including 3.2.0-Cloud/6.2.0-Data Center. It enables\n attackers to perform privileged remote code execution on systems with the\n Asset Discovery agent installed.\n * CVE-2023-22524 (CVSS rating: 9.6): This vulnerability is present in the\n Atlassian Companion application for MacOS, affecting all versions up to and\n including 2.0.0. It could allow attackers to execute code by leveraging\n WebSockets to circumvent Atlassian Companion blacklisting and macOS\n gatekeeper protection. \nGiven the increasing use of Atlassian solutions as attack vectors, users are\nstrongly advised to update their installations to the patched versions\nimmediately to mitigate these security risks. \nCisco \nCisco has recently addressed a significant vulnerability in its Firepower VPN,\nidentified as CVE-2023-20275. This bug impacts the AnyConnect SSL VPN in both\nthe Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) and Firepower Threat Defense (FTD)\nsoftware. The vulnerability posed a risk that allowed an authenticated remote\nattacker to send packets appearing to originate from the IP address of another\nVPN user. However, it\u2019s important to note that the attacker would not be able to\nreceive any return packets. \nIn response, Cisco has released software updates to rectify this issue and\nemphasized that there are no alternative workarounds for this vulnerability.\nWhile there have been no observed instances of exploitation in the wild, the\ndetails of this vulnerability are already being examined within the cyber\nunderground community. \nThe situation is further compounded by the ongoing exploitation of recent Cisco\nIOS XE vulnerabilities, specifically CVE-2023-20198 (rated CVSS 10) and\nCVE-2023-20273 (rated CVSS 7.2), as warned by the Shadowserver Foundation. These\nvulnerabilities have been actively targeted by hackers, leading to a significant\nnumber of compromised devices. \nInitially, attackers exploited these vulnerabilities to create high-privilege\naccounts and install a Lua-based backdoor, resulting in the takeover of\nvulnerable devices. At one point, up to 50,000 switches and routers were\ncompromised, with approximately 40,000 still infected even after the attackers\nupdated their implant. \nRecent data indicates that over 23,000 Cisco IOS XE devices are still infected\nwith the BadCandy backdoor. While the number of infections had been steadily\ndecreasing throughout November, a recent surge, particularly in Mexico and\nChile, suggests a new wave of attacks, potentially leading to an increase in\ncompromised devices. \nBluetooth \nMark Newlin, a researcher at Skysafe, has uncovered a critical Bluetooth\nvulnerability that poses a threat to various operating systems, including\nAndroid, Linux, MacOS, and iOS. Identified as CVE-2023-45866, this vulnerability\nis present in multiple Bluetooth stacks and allows for an authentication bypass.\nThis security flaw enables attackers to connect to a discoverable host without\nrequiring user confirmation, intercept connections, and inject keystrokes. The\nmechanism of the attack involves deceiving the target device into believing it\nis paired with a Bluetooth keyboard, exploiting the unauthenticated pairing\nprocess outlined in the Bluetooth specification. If exploited successfully, an\nattacker within close proximity could connect to the vulnerable device to\ninstall malicious applications or execute arbitrary commands. \nNotably, executing this attack does not require specialized hardware and can be\ncarried out using a standard Bluetooth adapter on a Linux computer. \nThe vulnerability impacts Android devices running version 4.2.2.2 (released in\nNovember 2012) and later, as well as Linux, iOS, and macOS devices. It is\nparticularly concerning for macOS and iOS devices, as it remains exploitable\neven when Bluetooth is enabled and the Magic Keyboard is paired, and even if\nApple\u2019s lockdown mode is active. Google\u2019s recent advisory highlights the\nseverity of CVE-2023-45866, noting its potential for remote privilege escalation\nwithout additional execution privileges. As of now, only the Android team has\naddressed this vulnerability with a patch. More technical details about this\nvulnerability are expected to be released in the future. \nVMware \nVMware has recently identified and patched a critical authentication bypass\nvulnerability in its Cloud Director software, which is essential for managing\ncloud services within Virtual Data Centers (VDC). This particular vulnerability,\ntracked as CVE-2023-34060 and referenced in VMSA-2023-0026, specifically impacts\ninstances of VCD Appliance 10.5 that have undergone an upgrade from an earlier\nversion. \nIt\u2019s important to note that this vulnerability does not affect new installations\nof VCD Appliance 10.5, nor does it impact Linux deployments or other devices.\nThe vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers with network access to the\nappliance to remotely exploit the flaw. These attacks are of low complexity and\ndo not require user interaction, leading to bypassing login restrictions when\naccessing ports 22 (ssh) and 5480 (device management console). \nVMware responded promptly to this security issue, releasing a patch just a few\nweeks after its discovery on November 14. Notably, fresh installations of VMware\nCloud Director Appliance 10.5 are not subject to this vulnerability. \nFor those who may need additional time to implement the patches, VMware has not\nonly provided a patch but also issued advisories for VMSA-2023-0026 and a\nworkaround. This workaround is specifically designed for affected versions of\nVCD Appliance 10.5.0 and involves executing a special script to mitigate the\nvulnerability temporarily. \nZyxel \nZyxel has recently taken steps to address multiple vulnerabilities in its NAS\ndevices, including three critical issues that pose a significant threat. These\nvulnerabilities enable unauthenticated attackers to execute operating system\ncommands on certain Zyxel NAS models, specifically the NAS326 running version\n5.21(AAZF.14)C0 and the NAS542 running version 5.21(ABAG.11)C0, as well as\nearlier versions of both models. These NAS devices, known for their centralized\nstorage capabilities, are widely used for data backup, media streaming, remote\naccess, and collaboration, making them popular among small and medium-sized\nbusinesses, as well as professionals in IT, video, and design.\nThe vulnerabilities patched by Zyxel include: \n* CVE-2023-4473 (Score 9.8): A command injection flaw in the web server of\n Zyxel NAS devices, allowing unauthenticated attackers to execute operating\n system commands via a specially crafted URL.\n * CVE-2023-4474 (Score 9.8): A vulnerability in the WSGI server of these\n devices that permits unauthenticated attackers to execute OS commands through\n a crafted URL.\n * CVE-2023-35137 (Score 7.5): A misauthentication issue in the authentication\n module, potentially allowing unauthenticated attackers to access system\n information via a crafted URL.\n * CVE-2023-35138 (Score 9.8): A command injection bug in the\n show_zysync_server_contents function, enabling unauthenticated attackers to\n execute operating system commands via a crafted HTTP POST request.\n * CVE-2023-37927 (Score 8.8): A vulnerability in a CGI program that allows\n authenticated attackers to execute OS commands through a crafted URL.\n * CVE-2023-37928 (Score 8.8): A post-authentication command injection issue in\n the WSGI server, allowing authenticated attackers to execute OS commands via\n a crafted URL. \nThese vulnerabilities, if exploited, could allow attackers to gain unauthorized\naccess, execute operating system commands, obtain sensitive system information,\nor even take full control of the affected Zyxel NAS devices. Therefore, Zyxel\nstrongly advises NAS users to update their devices with the latest patches,\nemphasizing that there are no known workarounds or mitigations for these\nvulnerabilities. \nApple \nApple has urgently released updates to address two critical zero-day\nvulnerabilities, CVE-2023-42916 and CVE-2023-42917, which are currently being\nexploited in attacks targeting iPhone, iPad, and Mac users. \nThese vulnerabilities impact a range of Apple devices, including iPhone XS,\nvarious iPad Pro models (12.9-inch 2nd generation, 10.5-inch, 11-inch 1st\ngeneration), iPad Air 3rd generation, iPad 6th generation, iPad mini 5th\ngeneration, and Mac computers running Monterey, Ventura, and Sonoma. The\nsecurity flaws are found in the WebKit browser engine and pose significant\nrisks. They enable attackers to perform out-of-bounds reads, potentially\naccessing sensitive information, and to execute remote code (RCE) through memory\ncorruption when users visit malicious web pages. \nTo mitigate these vulnerabilities, Apple has released updates for devices\nrunning iOS 17.1.2, iPadOS 17.1.2, macOS Sonoma 14.1.2, and Safari 17.1.2. These\nupdates enhance input validation and introduce measures to block such attacks. \nThe discovery and disclosure of these new zero-days are credited to Cl\u00e9ment\nLesigne from Google TAG. Based on Lesigne\u2019s prior work, there is speculation\nthat these vulnerabilities may be related to spyware. However, Apple has not\nconfirmed these details. \nIt\u2019s important to note that CVE-2023-42916 and CVE-2023-42917 represent the 19th\nand 20th zero-day vulnerabilities that Apple has patched this year. The majority\nof these have been associated with targeted attacks and cyber espionage\ncampaigns. \nQlik Sense \nArctic Wolf researchers have recently released a report detailing the first\ndocumented instance of CACTUS ransomware being used in an attack targeting Qlik\nSense, a cloud-based analytics and business intelligence platform. This campaign\nis notable for its exploitation of vulnerabilities in the platform. \nThe experts have identified three key vulnerabilities that were likely exploited\nin these attacks: \n* CVE-2023-41265 (CVSS: 9.9): This vulnerability allows a remote attacker to\n escalate privileges and send executable requests to the server.\n * CVE-2023-41266 (CVSS: 6.5): It enables attackers to send HTTP requests to\n unauthorized endpoints.\n * CVE-2023-48365 (CVSS: 9.9): Linked to improper HTTP header validation, this\n flaw leads to privilege escalation for remote attackers. \nIt\u2019s important to note that CVE-2023-48365 emerged as a result of an incomplete\npatch for CVE-2023-41265. Both CVE-2023-41265 and CVE-2023-41266 were initially\ndisclosed by Praetorian in late August 2023, with the patch for CVE-2023-48365\nbeing released later, on November 20. \nDuring these attacks, the perpetrators manipulated the Qlik Sense scheduler\nservice to execute processes that download additional tools. These tools\nfacilitate resilience monitoring and enable remote management configuration. The\ntools include ManageEngine Unified Endpoint Management and Security (UEMS),\nAnyDesk, and Plink. The attackers also took measures such as uninstalling Sophos\nsoftware, changing administrator account passwords, and creating an RDP tunnel\nthrough Plink. The attack ultimately leads to the deployment of ransomware, with\nthe attackers additionally using rclone to extract data. \nownCloud \nCritical vulnerabilities have been identified in ownCloud, an open-source file\nsharing and collaboration software, which pose risks of sensitive information\ndisclosure and authentication bypass. This software is extensively used, with\nmore than 200,000 installations, 600 enterprise customers, and 200 million users\nworldwide. \nThe most critical of these vulnerabilities, receiving a maximum CVSS score of\n10/10, impacts the Graphapi feature. This issue involves a third-party library\nused by Graphapi, which generates a URL that, when accessed, reveals detailed\nPHP environment configuration (phpinfo). This vulnerability affects versions\n0.2.0 through 0.3.0 of Graphapi and exposes critical information such as the\nownCloud admin password, mail server credentials, license key, and other\nsensitive data. Notably, deactivating the Graphapi application does not resolve\nthis vulnerability. As a precaution, administrators are advised to change their\nownCloud admin password, object store/S3 access key, and mail server and\ndatabase credentials. \nIn response, ownCloud has taken measures to disable phpinfo in Docker containers\nand plans to implement additional security enhancements in future major releases\nto prevent similar vulnerabilities. \nThe second vulnerability, rated 9.8/10 in severity, involves an authentication\nbypass in the WebDAV API through pre-signed URLs. This flaw affects ownCloud\nbase versions from 10.6.0 to 10.13.0 and enables unauthorized access,\nmodification, or deletion of any file if the victim\u2019s username is known and no\nsignature key is configured (the default setting). The recommended fix is to\nprohibit the use of pre-signed URLs when no signing key is set for the file\nowner. \nA third bug, with a CVSS rating of 9/10, affects the oauth2 application in\nversions prior to 0.6.1, allowing for subdomain validation bypass. In the oauth2\napplication, an attacker can use a specially crafted redirect URL to circumvent\nthe validation code, redirecting callbacks to a domain under the attacker\u2019s\ncontrol. The suggested solution is to strengthen the validation code in the\nOauth2 application, with a temporary workaround being to disable the \u201callow\nsubdomains\u201d option. \nSoon after the public disclosure of these vulnerabilities on November 21,\nincluding CVE-2023-49104 and CVE-2023-49105, exploitation attempts were\nreported, specifically targeting CVE-2023-49103. The Shadowserver Foundation\ndiscovered around 11,000 online OwnCloud instances potentially at risk, with\nGermany, the United States, and France having the highest number of vulnerable\ninstances. \nIn light of the recent exploitation of file sharing platform vulnerabilities, as\nevidenced in the CLOP ransomware case, it is critical for ownCloud\nadministrators to promptly apply the recommended fixes and update their software\nlibraries to safeguard against these threats. \nCrushFTP \nA critical zero-day vulnerability, identified as CVE-2023-43177, has been\ndiscovered in CrushFTP, a widely used file transfer server, posing a significant\nthreat to thousands of organizations. First identified in August 2023, this\nvulnerability is particularly concerning due to CrushFTP\u2019s popularity for secure\nfile transfers across various devices and platforms in the business sector. \nThe flaw enables an unauthenticated attacker to gain unrestricted access to all\nfiles on CrushFTP, execute arbitrary programs on the host server, and obtain\npasswords in clear text. The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the\nimproper handling of AS2 headers within CrushFTP. By exploiting these headers,\nan attacker can manipulate Java properties user information, which in turn\nallows them to set arbitrary permissions. This can lead to reading and deleting\nfiles, ultimately resulting in root-level system compromise and remote code\nexecution (RCE). \nIn response to the discovery of this vulnerability, the CrushFTP development\nteam acted swiftly, releasing a patch in CrushFTP 10.5.2. Despite this prompt\naction, the risk of exploitation remains a concern, especially since a Proof of\nConcept (PoC) for the vulnerability has been developed and is currently\navailable. \nGiven the seriousness of this security issue, organizations using CrushFTP are\nstrongly advised to apply the patch immediately and take additional measures to\nsecure their systems. The developers have highlighted that AS2 is a specialized\nfeature, so any unusual activity related to AS2 on servers should be treated\nwith high suspicion, as it could indicate a potential attack. \nFortiSIEM \nFortinet has issued a warning regarding a critical command injection\nvulnerability in the FortiSIEM server, a security concern that unauthenticated\nremote attackers could exploit to execute commands via API requests. \nThis vulnerability, designated as CVE-2023-36553, has been given a severity\nrating of 9.3 by Fortinet, while NIST has assessed it at a higher score of 9.8.\nResearchers have identified CVE-2023-36553 as a derivative of another critical\nissue, CVE-2023-34992. This related vulnerability, involving improper input\nsanitization, was patched earlier in October. CVE-2023-36553 manifests when the\nprogram improperly handles API requests containing wildcards or controls,\npassing them to the operating system as executable commands. This flaw could\nlead to several dangerous outcomes, such as unauthorized data access. \nImpacting FortiSIEM versions 4.7 through 5.4, Fortinet is urging users to\nupgrade to one of the safer versions \u2013 6.4.3, 6.5.2, 6.6.4, 6.7.6, 7.0.1, or\n7.1.0 and later. \nGiven that Fortinet\u2019s solutions are widely utilized in critical sectors such as\nhealthcare, financial services, retail, e-commerce, and government facilities,\nunpatched systems pose a significant risk. In the past, unprotected instances of\nFortinet products have frequently been targeted in ART (Advanced Reconnaissance\nand Targeting) attacks, aiming to breach an organization\u2019s network. \nAMD \nA collaborative team of researchers from the Helmholtz IS Center CISPA in\nGermany, Graz University of Technology in Austria, and Youheng Lu has unveiled a\nnew vulnerability in AMD processors, dubbed CacheWarp. This discovery represents\na significant software bug injection attack targeting AMD SEV-ES and SEV-SNP.\nCacheWarp enables the architectural reversion of modified guest virtual machine\ncache lines to their original state, thereby compromising virtual machines\nthrough memory writes, privilege escalation, and remote code executions (RCEs).\nThis vulnerability specifically affects AMD\u2019s Secure Encrypted Virtualization\n(SEV) CPU extension, which plays a crucial role in protecting against malicious\nhypervisors and reducing the attack surface of virtual machines in cloud\nenvironments by encrypting data. \nThe researchers highlight that CacheWarp could permit hackers to gain control\nover and breach encrypted virtual machines, thereby escalating privileges. For\nexample, attackers could exploit CacheWarp to revert authentication variables to\nan earlier state, hijacking a previously authenticated session. Furthermore,\nCacheWarp can be used to manipulate return addresses in the stack, altering the\ncontrol flow of a program. This attack is attributed to a hardware problem in\nprocessors, with the root cause being an architectural flaw. \nCacheWarp poses a threat to any system running on AMD processors that support\nSEV. However, the risk is specifically significant for users deploying secure\nvirtual machines using SEV. The underlying vulnerability, tracked as\nCVE-2023-20592, affects various AMD systems with SEV-enabled processors,\nincluding 1st and 2nd generation EPYC (SEV and SEV-ES), and 3rd generation EPYC\n(SEV, SEV-ES, SEV-SNP), but does not impact the 4th generation AMD EPYC Genoa\n(Zen 4). \nThe researchers have provided comprehensive documentation of their findings,\nlaunched a dedicated website to summarize the attack, and released a video\ndemonstrating CacheWarp gaining root privileges and bypassing OpenSSH\nauthentication to escalate to root via sudo. \nAMD has responded with a security advisory. While no mitigations are available\nfor 1st or 2nd generation EPYC processors, the company has released a microcode\nfix for 3rd generation AMD EPYC processors with SEV-SNP enabled, ensuring no\nperformance degradation as a result of the fix. \nIntel \nIntel has recently addressed a significant vulnerability present in its range of\nCPUs, including the newest Alder Lake, Raptor Lake, and Sapphire Rapids\nmicroarchitectures, which span desktop, server, mobile, and embedded platforms. \nThis vulnerability, cataloged as CVE-2023-23583, is identified as a redundant\nprefix issue. It has the potential to be exploited in several ways, such as\nescalating privileges, accessing sensitive information, or triggering a Denial\nof Service (DoS) condition, which could lead to substantial losses, especially\nfor cloud providers. Intel\u2019s investigation revealed that under certain\nconditions, the execution of the REP MOVSB instruction, if encoded with a\nredundant REX prefix, might cause unpredictable system behavior. This could lead\nto a system crash or freeze and, in limited scenarios, enable an elevation of\nprivilege (EoP) from CPL3 to CPL0. Intel assesses that the likelihood of this\nproblem occurring in any software is low, as redundant REX prefixes are\ngenerally not present in code and are not generated by compilers. Nevertheless,\nthe potential for malicious exploitation exists, requiring the execution of\narbitrary code. \nThis issue, also independently identified by several Google research groups and\ntermed \u2018Reptar,\u2019 involves the interpretation of redundant prefixes by CPUs.\nAccording to Phil Venables, VP and IS Director at Google Cloud, successful\nexploitation can bypass the security boundaries of the CPU, leading to unusual\nand problematic behavior. Systems equipped with vulnerable CPUs, including those\nbased on Alder Lake, Raptor Lake, and Sapphire Rapids architectures, have\nalready been updated with new microcode. Notably, these updates did not impact\nsystem performance. \nIntel has released microcode updates for other affected processors and strongly\nadvises users to update their BIOS, operating systems, and drivers to safeguard\nagainst this vulnerability. \n--\n%40googlegroups.com", "metadata": {"id": "f45c3f3c-dff4-2f03-3448-41ec6b91b689", "receivedDateTime": "2023-12-12T18:53:38+00:00", "topic": "December Patch Tuesday and other vulns: analysis by Action1", "subject": "[patchmanagement] December Patch Tuesday and other vulns: analysis by Action1", "published": "2023-12-12T00:00:00", "collection": "patch_management", "cve_fixes": "", "cve_mentions": null, "tags": "", "conversation_link": "//groups.google.com/d/msgid/patchmanagement/bc549e62-4d44-4a77-ad37-70305e375340n%40googlegroups.com", "email_text_original": "Microsoft: 34 total, NO zero-days (yay!), 4 critical. \nOther important vulnerabilities: Microsoft Access, Google Chrome, Mozilla\nFirefox, WordPress, Web Password Managers, Atlassian, Cisco, Bluetooth, VMware,\nZyxel, Apple, Qlik Sense, ownCloud, CrushFTP, FortiSIEM, AMD, and Intel. \nSee Action1 Vulnerability Digest\n[https://can01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.action1.com%2Fpatch-tuesday-december-2023%2F%3Fvmp&data=05%7C02%7Cemail_ingestion%40bighatgroup.com%7Cf6d983876e5440df428e08dbfb43a324%7C5a01497e1bcb4711b6e6d24f4ab00393%7C0%7C0%7C638380040177324493%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=7ged27Zk2m8%2FVoAjwKGqYYhkrPieh76hulrrYW%2BMgEk%3D&reserved=0]\u00a0for\nreal-time updates. \nQuick summary:\n * Windows: 63 vulnerabilities, three zero-days, three critical\n * Microsoft Access: vulnerability allowing to obtain a victim's NTLM hash\n * Chrome: six vulnerabilities, including zero-day CVE-2023-6345\n * Firefox: 19 vulnerabilities\n * WordPress: CVE-2023-6063\n * Web Password Managers: AutoSpill vulnerability\n * Atlassian: four critical vulnerabilities\n * Cisco:CVE-2023-20275, CVE-2023-20198 (CVSS 10!) and CVE-2023-20273\n * Bluetooth: CVE-2023-45866\n * VMware: CVE-2023-34060\n * Zyxel: six vulnerabilities, three critical\n * Apple: two zero-days CVE-2023-42916 and CVE-2023-42917\n * Qlik Sense: three vulnerabilities involved in CACTUS ransomware attacks\n * ownCloud: CVE-2023-49103 (CVSS 10!), CVE-2023-49104 and CVE-2023-49105\n * CrushFTP: zero-day CVE-2023-43177\n * FortiSIEM: CVE-2023-36553\n * AMD: CVE-2023-20592\n * Intel: CVE-2023-23583 \nMicrosoft Vulnerabilities \nThis month\u2019s Patch Tuesday from Microsoft presents a welcome change, with a\ntotal of 34 fixed vulnerabilities, slightly fewer than in November. Among these,\nthere are four critical vulnerabilities that have been addressed, marking a\nslight increase from the previous month. Notably, the only vulnerability with a\nProof of Concept (PoC) this month is specifically related to AMD chipsets. While\nDecember brings a welcome pause from zero-day vulnerabilities, it\u2019s crucial to\nremember that hackers often intensify their efforts during the holidays, so it\u2019s\nessential to secure your systems and endpoints before the holiday season begins.\nThis proactive approach will help you enjoy the holidays without concerns about\ncybersecurity. Let\u2019s dive into the details of the most significant critical\nupdates from this month\u2019s release. \nMicrosoft Access \nAcros Security developers have stepped up to address a significant issue in\nMicrosoft Access. \nOn November 9, 2023, Check Point Research researchers revealed an information\ndisclosure vulnerability in Microsoft Access. This flaw allows attackers to\nobtain a victim\u2019s NTLM hash. It occurs when the victim opens a Microsoft Office\ndocument embedded with an Access database linked to a remote SQL Server database\nusing \u201cWindows NT authentication.\u201d This forces authentication, thus leaking the\nNTLM hash each time Access updates a table with this link. Unlike typical forced\nauthentication problems, this one uses SQL Server port 1433 instead of SMB and\nRPC, with the ability to use any port, including firewall-friendly ports 80 or\n443. Haifei researchers proposed an AutoExec macro solution to automatically\nopen a table and prompt an update, circumventing these issues. \nCheck Point initially reported this vulnerability to Microsoft in January 2023.\nHowever, by July, they had not received a definitive response, as the issue was\ndeemed \u201clow/no severity\u201d by the MSRC. Although Access began showing a security\ndialog box when opening a Proof of Concept (PoC) file, closing this dialog still\ntriggered AutoExec, sending credentials to the attacker\u2019s server. The only\nsolution to prevent this exploit is to forcibly terminate the msaccess.exe\nprocess. Over recent years, Microsoft has addressed some vulnerabilities but\nignored others, such as DFSCoerce, PrinterBug/SpoolSample, and PetitPotam.\nRemotePotato0 and ShadowCoerce were initially ignored too but were discreetly\npatched 9 and 6 months after their discovery, respectively. In contrast, a\nsimilar WordPad vulnerability was openly patched by Microsoft just last month. \nIn conclusion, the researchers believe Microsoft has no plans to rectify this\nAccess issue, a stance they find problematic given its similarity in impact to\nthe WordPad vulnerability. While Microsoft\u2019s response remains uncertain, 0patch\nhas taken the initiative, releasing a micropatch for Microsoft Office to\nmitigate this security risk. \nGoogle Chrome \nGoogle is responding to a significant cybersecurity threat with an emergency\nupdate aimed at addressing the sixth zero-day vulnerability discovered in Chrome\nthis year. This vulnerability, actively exploited in real-world attacks, is one\nof seven critical issues currently being patched. \nThe primary concern is CVE-2023-6345, an integer overflow issue in the Skia 2D\ngraphics library, an open-source project. This flaw can lead to a range of\nproblems, from Denial of Service (DoS) to Remote Code Execution (RCE). It allows\nremote attackers to bypass Chrome\u2019s sandbox protections via a specially crafted\nHTML page, potentially after compromising the renderer process. This\nvulnerability was identified last Friday by Google TAG researchers, who focus on\nspyware and Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) activity. \nInterestingly, this isn\u2019t the first time Google has addressed a similar issue.\nIn April 2023, they patched another integer overflow vulnerability\n(CVE-2023-2136) in Skia. Given that the previous flaw was also exploited as a\nzero-day, CVE-2023-6345 might represent a method to circumvent that earlier\npatch. \nThe other vulnerabilities addressed in this update include: \n* CVE-2023-6348: A type confusion issue in Spellcheck, reported by Mark Brand\n   of Google Project Zero on October 23, 2023.\n * CVE-2023-6347: A use-after-free error in Mojo, reported by Leecraso and Guang\n   Gong of the 360 Vulnerability Research Institute on October 21, 2023.\n * CVE-2023-6346: A use-after-free error in WebAudio, reported by Huang Xilin of\n   Ant Group Light-Year Security Lab on November 9, 2023.\n * CVE-2023-6350: An out-of-bounds memory access in libavif, reported by Fudan\n   University on November 13, 2023.\n * CVE-2023-6351: Another use-after-free error in libavif, also reported by\n   Fudan University. \nGoogle has withheld detailed information on these vulnerabilities and their\nexploitation, pending the complete rollout of the updates. These updates are\navailable for Windows (version 119.0.6045.199/.200) and Mac and Linux (version\n119.0.6045.199). \nMozilla Firefox \nMozilla\u2019s latest release, Firefox 119, not only brings new features and bug\nfixes but also includes 25 security updates. Of these, 17 vulnerabilities,\nprimarily grouped under CVE-2023-5730 and CVE-2023-5731, are classified as\ndangerous due to memory-related issues. These include buffer overflows and\naccessing previously freed memory areas, which could potentially enable an\nattacker to execute code when specific, specially crafted web pages are\naccessed. \nAdditionally, a separate critical vulnerability, identified as CVE-2023-5721,\nposes a risk by allowing clickjacking. This vulnerability could be exploited to\nmanipulate users into inadvertently confirming or canceling certain browser\ndialogues or warnings. \nWordPress \nA significant security concern has emerged for users of the WP Fastest Cache\nplugin, which is widely used on WordPress sites. This plugin, installed on over\n1 million websites, is designed to enhance page load times, boost visitor\ninteraction, and improve Google search rankings. However, a SQL vulnerability in\nthe plugin puts more than 600,000 websites at risk, as revealed by the WPScan\nteam at Automattic. This vulnerability, identified as CVE-2023-6063 and rated\nwith a severity of 8.6, affects versions of the plugin dating back to 1.2.2. It\nstems from an issue in the is_user_admin function of the\nWpFastestCacheCreateCache class, where the $username input from cookies is\nimproperly sanitized. This oversight allows unauthenticated attackers to\nmanipulate the SQL query, gaining access to the site\u2019s database, which often\ncontains sensitive user data, passwords, and site configurations. With its\npotential for easy exploitation, the urgency for users to update to the latest\nplugin version, 1.2.2, cannot be overstated. \nAdditionally, WordPress\u2019s release of update 6.4.2 addresses another critical\nvulnerability. Discovered by Wordfence, this vulnerability involves a\nproperty-oriented programming (POP) chain in the WP_HTML_Token class, introduced\nin WordPress 6.4. Under certain conditions, it could allow attackers to execute\narbitrary PHP code on vulnerable sites. The POP chain vulnerability is\nparticularly concerning because it enables attackers to hijack application flow\nand potentially take control of a site. However, exploiting this vulnerability\nrequires control over all properties of a deserialized object, achievable via\nthe PHP unserialize() function. Although this vulnerability is not critical on\nits own, it becomes significantly more dangerous when combined with a PHP object\ninjection vulnerability in a plugin or theme add-on. \nThe exploit chain, already available on GitHub and added to the PHP Generic\nGadget Chains (PHPGGC) project, heightens the risk. Patchstack advises users to\nmanually check their websites and update to the latest WordPress version. They\nalso recommend replacing any calls to the unserialize function with safer\nalternatives like json_encode and json_decode. \nIn summary, while both vulnerabilities pose critical risks under certain\nconditions, the recommended course of action is for administrators to promptly\nupgrade to the latest versions of both the WP Fastest Cache plugin and\nWordPress. \nWordPress users have been alerted to a critical Remote Code Execution (RCE)\nvulnerability in the Backup Migration plugin, identified as CVE-2023-6553 and\nrated with a CVSS score of 9.8. This severe vulnerability permits\nunauthenticated attackers to hijack target websites by executing remote code\nthrough PHP injection. The specific point of exploit is found in the file\n/includes/backup-heart.php. \nThis critical bug was first identified by the Nex Team, who promptly reported\ntheir findings to Wordfence. Wordfence then quickly communicated the issue to\nthe developers of the Backup Migration plugin. The vulnerability impacts all\nplugin versions up to and including Backup Migration 1.3.6 and can be exploited\nwithout any user interaction. Despite the swift release of a patch to address\nthis issue, an estimated 50,000 WordPress sites using this plugin remain\nvulnerable. \nAs a precautionary measure, experts are urging users to immediately update the\nBackup Migration plugin. In addition to this, they recommend backing up site\ndata and changing WordPress login credentials to further secure their websites\nagainst potential exploits. \nWeb Password Managers \nRecent research conducted by experts at the Indian Institute of Technology in\nHyderabad has uncovered a significant vulnerability in several widely-used\nAndroid password managers. This vulnerability, known as AutoSpill, poses a\nserious threat as it allows attackers to access user credentials. The\nvulnerability becomes exploitable when users employ the AutoFill password\nfeature in conjunction with WebView. \nIn their investigation, the researchers tested AutoSpill against popular\npassword managers like 1Password, LastPass, Keeper, and Enpass. They discovered\nthat most of these applications were still vulnerable, even when JavaScript\ninjection protection was active. Notably, all the password managers tested\nshowed vulnerabilities when JavaScript was enabled, and the research was\nconducted on the latest versions of Android. \nThe severity of this finding cannot be overstated, given that password managers\nare expected to be among the most secure applications. The developers of these\npassword managers have been informed about the issues and are currently working\non fixes. However, in light of these findings, the researchers advise users to\nexercise caution. As a temporary measure, it is recommended to avoid using these\npassword management applications until the vulnerabilities are fully addressed. \nAtlassian \nAtlassian has announced the release of patches for four critical vulnerabilities\nin its software suite, addressing flaws that could potentially lead to Remote\nCode Execution (RCE) if exploited. \nThe vulnerabilities are as follows: \n* CVE-2022-1471 (CVSS score: 9.8): This is a deserialization vulnerability\n   found in the SnakeYAML library, affecting multiple Atlassian products. It\n   poses a high risk of remote code execution.\n * CVE-2023-22522 (CVSS score: 9.0): This vulnerability affects all versions of\n   Confluence Data Center and Confluence Server, including 4.0.0 and later.\n   Atlassian has identified it as a pattern injection vulnerability, which\n   allows even an anonymous attacker to execute code by manipulating insecure\n   user input on a Confluence page.\n * CVE-2023-22523 (CVSS score: 9.8): Found in Assets Discovery for Jira Service\n   Management Cloud, Server, and Data Center, this vulnerability affects all\n   versions up to and including 3.2.0-Cloud/6.2.0-Data Center. It enables\n   attackers to perform privileged remote code execution on systems with the\n   Asset Discovery agent installed.\n * CVE-2023-22524 (CVSS rating: 9.6): This vulnerability is present in the\n   Atlassian Companion application for MacOS, affecting all versions up to and\n   including 2.0.0. It could allow attackers to execute code by leveraging\n   WebSockets to circumvent Atlassian Companion blacklisting and macOS\n   gatekeeper protection. \nGiven the increasing use of Atlassian solutions as attack vectors, users are\nstrongly advised to update their installations to the patched versions\nimmediately to mitigate these security risks. \nCisco \nCisco has recently addressed a significant vulnerability in its Firepower VPN,\nidentified as CVE-2023-20275. This bug impacts the AnyConnect SSL VPN in both\nthe Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) and Firepower Threat Defense (FTD)\nsoftware. The vulnerability posed a risk that allowed an authenticated remote\nattacker to send packets appearing to originate from the IP address of another\nVPN user. However, it\u2019s important to note that the attacker would not be able to\nreceive any return packets. \nIn response, Cisco has released software updates to rectify this issue and\nemphasized that there are no alternative workarounds for this vulnerability.\nWhile there have been no observed instances of exploitation in the wild, the\ndetails of this vulnerability are already being examined within the cyber\nunderground community. \nThe situation is further compounded by the ongoing exploitation of recent Cisco\nIOS XE vulnerabilities, specifically CVE-2023-20198 (rated CVSS 10) and\nCVE-2023-20273 (rated CVSS 7.2), as warned by the Shadowserver Foundation. These\nvulnerabilities have been actively targeted by hackers, leading to a significant\nnumber of compromised devices. \nInitially, attackers exploited these vulnerabilities to create high-privilege\naccounts and install a Lua-based backdoor, resulting in the takeover of\nvulnerable devices. At one point, up to 50,000 switches and routers were\ncompromised, with approximately 40,000 still infected even after the attackers\nupdated their implant. \nRecent data indicates that over 23,000 Cisco IOS XE devices are still infected\nwith the BadCandy backdoor. While the number of infections had been steadily\ndecreasing throughout November, a recent surge, particularly in Mexico and\nChile, suggests a new wave of attacks, potentially leading to an increase in\ncompromised devices. \nBluetooth \nMark Newlin, a researcher at Skysafe, has uncovered a critical Bluetooth\nvulnerability that poses a threat to various operating systems, including\nAndroid, Linux, MacOS, and iOS. Identified as CVE-2023-45866, this vulnerability\nis present in multiple Bluetooth stacks and allows for an authentication bypass.\nThis security flaw enables attackers to connect to a discoverable host without\nrequiring user confirmation, intercept connections, and inject keystrokes. The\nmechanism of the attack involves deceiving the target device into believing it\nis paired with a Bluetooth keyboard, exploiting the unauthenticated pairing\nprocess outlined in the Bluetooth specification. If exploited successfully, an\nattacker within close proximity could connect to the vulnerable device to\ninstall malicious applications or execute arbitrary commands. \nNotably, executing this attack does not require specialized hardware and can be\ncarried out using a standard Bluetooth adapter on a Linux computer. \nThe vulnerability impacts Android devices running version 4.2.2.2 (released in\nNovember 2012) and later, as well as Linux, iOS, and macOS devices. It is\nparticularly concerning for macOS and iOS devices, as it remains exploitable\neven when Bluetooth is enabled and the Magic Keyboard is paired, and even if\nApple\u2019s lockdown mode is active. Google\u2019s recent advisory highlights the\nseverity of CVE-2023-45866, noting its potential for remote privilege escalation\nwithout additional execution privileges. As of now, only the Android team has\naddressed this vulnerability with a patch. More technical details about this\nvulnerability are expected to be released in the future. \nVMware \nVMware has recently identified and patched a critical authentication bypass\nvulnerability in its Cloud Director software, which is essential for managing\ncloud services within Virtual Data Centers (VDC). This particular vulnerability,\ntracked as CVE-2023-34060 and referenced in VMSA-2023-0026, specifically impacts\ninstances of VCD Appliance 10.5 that have undergone an upgrade from an earlier\nversion. \nIt\u2019s important to note that this vulnerability does not affect new installations\nof VCD Appliance 10.5, nor does it impact Linux deployments or other devices.\nThe vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers with network access to the\nappliance to remotely exploit the flaw. These attacks are of low complexity and\ndo not require user interaction, leading to bypassing login restrictions when\naccessing ports 22 (ssh) and 5480 (device management console). \nVMware responded promptly to this security issue, releasing a patch just a few\nweeks after its discovery on November 14. Notably, fresh installations of VMware\nCloud Director Appliance 10.5 are not subject to this vulnerability. \nFor those who may need additional time to implement the patches, VMware has not\nonly provided a patch but also issued advisories for VMSA-2023-0026 and a\nworkaround. This workaround is specifically designed for affected versions of\nVCD Appliance 10.5.0 and involves executing a special script to mitigate the\nvulnerability temporarily. \nZyxel \nZyxel has recently taken steps to address multiple vulnerabilities in its NAS\ndevices, including three critical issues that pose a significant threat. These\nvulnerabilities enable unauthenticated attackers to execute operating system\ncommands on certain Zyxel NAS models, specifically the NAS326 running version\n5.21(AAZF.14)C0 and the NAS542 running version 5.21(ABAG.11)C0, as well as\nearlier versions of both models. These NAS devices, known for their centralized\nstorage capabilities, are widely used for data backup, media streaming, remote\naccess, and collaboration, making them popular among small and medium-sized\nbusinesses, as well as professionals in IT, video, and design.\nThe vulnerabilities patched by Zyxel include: \n* CVE-2023-4473 (Score 9.8): A command injection flaw in the web server of\n   Zyxel NAS devices, allowing unauthenticated attackers to execute operating\n   system commands via a specially crafted URL.\n * CVE-2023-4474 (Score 9.8): A vulnerability in the WSGI server of these\n   devices that permits unauthenticated attackers to execute OS commands through\n   a crafted URL.\n * CVE-2023-35137 (Score 7.5): A misauthentication issue in the authentication\n   module, potentially allowing unauthenticated attackers to access system\n   information via a crafted URL.\n * CVE-2023-35138 (Score 9.8): A command injection bug in the\n   show_zysync_server_contents function, enabling unauthenticated attackers to\n   execute operating system commands via a crafted HTTP POST request.\n * CVE-2023-37927 (Score 8.8): A vulnerability in a CGI program that allows\n   authenticated attackers to execute OS commands through a crafted URL.\n * CVE-2023-37928 (Score 8.8): A post-authentication command injection issue in\n   the WSGI server, allowing authenticated attackers to execute OS commands via\n   a crafted URL. \nThese vulnerabilities, if exploited, could allow attackers to gain unauthorized\naccess, execute operating system commands, obtain sensitive system information,\nor even take full control of the affected Zyxel NAS devices. Therefore, Zyxel\nstrongly advises NAS users to update their devices with the latest patches,\nemphasizing that there are no known workarounds or mitigations for these\nvulnerabilities. \nApple \nApple has urgently released updates to address two critical zero-day\nvulnerabilities, CVE-2023-42916 and CVE-2023-42917, which are currently being\nexploited in attacks targeting iPhone, iPad, and Mac users. \nThese vulnerabilities impact a range of Apple devices, including iPhone XS,\nvarious iPad Pro models (12.9-inch 2nd generation, 10.5-inch, 11-inch 1st\ngeneration), iPad Air 3rd generation, iPad 6th generation, iPad mini 5th\ngeneration, and Mac computers running Monterey, Ventura, and Sonoma. The\nsecurity flaws are found in the WebKit browser engine and pose significant\nrisks. They enable attackers to perform out-of-bounds reads, potentially\naccessing sensitive information, and to execute remote code (RCE) through memory\ncorruption when users visit malicious web pages. \nTo mitigate these vulnerabilities, Apple has released updates for devices\nrunning iOS 17.1.2, iPadOS 17.1.2, macOS Sonoma 14.1.2, and Safari 17.1.2. These\nupdates enhance input validation and introduce measures to block such attacks. \nThe discovery and disclosure of these new zero-days are credited to Cl\u00e9ment\nLesigne from Google TAG. Based on Lesigne\u2019s prior work, there is speculation\nthat these vulnerabilities may be related to spyware. However, Apple has not\nconfirmed these details. \nIt\u2019s important to note that CVE-2023-42916 and CVE-2023-42917 represent the 19th\nand 20th zero-day vulnerabilities that Apple has patched this year. The majority\nof these have been associated with targeted attacks and cyber espionage\ncampaigns. \nQlik Sense \nArctic Wolf researchers have recently released a report detailing the first\ndocumented instance of CACTUS ransomware being used in an attack targeting Qlik\nSense, a cloud-based analytics and business intelligence platform. This campaign\nis notable for its exploitation of vulnerabilities in the platform. \nThe experts have identified three key vulnerabilities that were likely exploited\nin these attacks: \n* CVE-2023-41265 (CVSS: 9.9): This vulnerability allows a remote attacker to\n   escalate privileges and send executable requests to the server.\n * CVE-2023-41266 (CVSS: 6.5): It enables attackers to send HTTP requests to\n   unauthorized endpoints.\n * CVE-2023-48365 (CVSS: 9.9): Linked to improper HTTP header validation, this\n   flaw leads to privilege escalation for remote attackers. \nIt\u2019s important to note that CVE-2023-48365 emerged as a result of an incomplete\npatch for CVE-2023-41265. Both CVE-2023-41265 and CVE-2023-41266 were initially\ndisclosed by Praetorian in late August 2023, with the patch for CVE-2023-48365\nbeing released later, on November 20. \nDuring these attacks, the perpetrators manipulated the Qlik Sense scheduler\nservice to execute processes that download additional tools. These tools\nfacilitate resilience monitoring and enable remote management configuration. The\ntools include ManageEngine Unified Endpoint Management and Security (UEMS),\nAnyDesk, and Plink. The attackers also took measures such as uninstalling Sophos\nsoftware, changing administrator account passwords, and creating an RDP tunnel\nthrough Plink. The attack ultimately leads to the deployment of ransomware, with\nthe attackers additionally using rclone to extract data. \nownCloud \nCritical vulnerabilities have been identified in ownCloud, an open-source file\nsharing and collaboration software, which pose risks of sensitive information\ndisclosure and authentication bypass. This software is extensively used, with\nmore than 200,000 installations, 600 enterprise customers, and 200 million users\nworldwide. \nThe most critical of these vulnerabilities, receiving a maximum CVSS score of\n10/10, impacts the Graphapi feature. This issue involves a third-party library\nused by Graphapi, which generates a URL that, when accessed, reveals detailed\nPHP environment configuration (phpinfo). This vulnerability affects versions\n0.2.0 through 0.3.0 of Graphapi and exposes critical information such as the\nownCloud admin password, mail server credentials, license key, and other\nsensitive data. Notably, deactivating the Graphapi application does not resolve\nthis vulnerability. As a precaution, administrators are advised to change their\nownCloud admin password, object store/S3 access key, and mail server and\ndatabase credentials. \nIn response, ownCloud has taken measures to disable phpinfo in Docker containers\nand plans to implement additional security enhancements in future major releases\nto prevent similar vulnerabilities. \nThe second vulnerability, rated 9.8/10 in severity, involves an authentication\nbypass in the WebDAV API through pre-signed URLs. This flaw affects ownCloud\nbase versions from 10.6.0 to 10.13.0 and enables unauthorized access,\nmodification, or deletion of any file if the victim\u2019s username is known and no\nsignature key is configured (the default setting). The recommended fix is to\nprohibit the use of pre-signed URLs when no signing key is set for the file\nowner. \nA third bug, with a CVSS rating of 9/10, affects the oauth2 application in\nversions prior to 0.6.1, allowing for subdomain validation bypass. In the oauth2\napplication, an attacker can use a specially crafted redirect URL to circumvent\nthe validation code, redirecting callbacks to a domain under the attacker\u2019s\ncontrol. The suggested solution is to strengthen the validation code in the\nOauth2 application, with a temporary workaround being to disable the \u201callow\nsubdomains\u201d option. \nSoon after the public disclosure of these vulnerabilities on November 21,\nincluding CVE-2023-49104 and CVE-2023-49105, exploitation attempts were\nreported, specifically targeting CVE-2023-49103. The Shadowserver Foundation\ndiscovered around 11,000 online OwnCloud instances potentially at risk, with\nGermany, the United States, and France having the highest number of vulnerable\ninstances. \nIn light of the recent exploitation of file sharing platform vulnerabilities, as\nevidenced in the CLOP ransomware case, it is critical for ownCloud\nadministrators to promptly apply the recommended fixes and update their software\nlibraries to safeguard against these threats. \nCrushFTP \nA critical zero-day vulnerability, identified as CVE-2023-43177, has been\ndiscovered in CrushFTP, a widely used file transfer server, posing a significant\nthreat to thousands of organizations. First identified in August 2023, this\nvulnerability is particularly concerning due to CrushFTP\u2019s popularity for secure\nfile transfers across various devices and platforms in the business sector. \nThe flaw enables an unauthenticated attacker to gain unrestricted access to all\nfiles on CrushFTP, execute arbitrary programs on the host server, and obtain\npasswords in clear text. The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the\nimproper handling of AS2 headers within CrushFTP. By exploiting these headers,\nan attacker can manipulate Java properties user information, which in turn\nallows them to set arbitrary permissions. This can lead to reading and deleting\nfiles, ultimately resulting in root-level system compromise and remote code\nexecution (RCE). \nIn response to the discovery of this vulnerability, the CrushFTP development\nteam acted swiftly, releasing a patch in CrushFTP 10.5.2. Despite this prompt\naction, the risk of exploitation remains a concern, especially since a Proof of\nConcept (PoC) for the vulnerability has been developed and is currently\navailable. \nGiven the seriousness of this security issue, organizations using CrushFTP are\nstrongly advised to apply the patch immediately and take additional measures to\nsecure their systems. The developers have highlighted that AS2 is a specialized\nfeature, so any unusual activity related to AS2 on servers should be treated\nwith high suspicion, as it could indicate a potential attack. \nFortiSIEM \nFortinet has issued a warning regarding a critical command injection\nvulnerability in the FortiSIEM server, a security concern that unauthenticated\nremote attackers could exploit to execute commands via API requests. \nThis vulnerability, designated as CVE-2023-36553, has been given a severity\nrating of 9.3 by Fortinet, while NIST has assessed it at a higher score of 9.8.\nResearchers have identified CVE-2023-36553 as a derivative of another critical\nissue, CVE-2023-34992. This related vulnerability, involving improper input\nsanitization, was patched earlier in October. CVE-2023-36553 manifests when the\nprogram improperly handles API requests containing wildcards or controls,\npassing them to the operating system as executable commands. This flaw could\nlead to several dangerous outcomes, such as unauthorized data access. \nImpacting FortiSIEM versions 4.7 through 5.4, Fortinet is urging users to\nupgrade to one of the safer versions \u2013 6.4.3, 6.5.2, 6.6.4, 6.7.6, 7.0.1, or\n7.1.0 and later. \nGiven that Fortinet\u2019s solutions are widely utilized in critical sectors such as\nhealthcare, financial services, retail, e-commerce, and government facilities,\nunpatched systems pose a significant risk. In the past, unprotected instances of\nFortinet products have frequently been targeted in ART (Advanced Reconnaissance\nand Targeting) attacks, aiming to breach an organization\u2019s network. \nAMD \nA collaborative team of researchers from the Helmholtz IS Center CISPA in\nGermany, Graz University of Technology in Austria, and Youheng Lu has unveiled a\nnew vulnerability in AMD processors, dubbed CacheWarp. This discovery represents\na significant software bug injection attack targeting AMD SEV-ES and SEV-SNP.\nCacheWarp enables the architectural reversion of modified guest virtual machine\ncache lines to their original state, thereby compromising virtual machines\nthrough memory writes, privilege escalation, and remote code executions (RCEs).\nThis vulnerability specifically affects AMD\u2019s Secure Encrypted Virtualization\n(SEV) CPU extension, which plays a crucial role in protecting against malicious\nhypervisors and reducing the attack surface of virtual machines in cloud\nenvironments by encrypting data. \nThe researchers highlight that CacheWarp could permit hackers to gain control\nover and breach encrypted virtual machines, thereby escalating privileges. For\nexample, attackers could exploit CacheWarp to revert authentication variables to\nan earlier state, hijacking a previously authenticated session. Furthermore,\nCacheWarp can be used to manipulate return addresses in the stack, altering the\ncontrol flow of a program. This attack is attributed to a hardware problem in\nprocessors, with the root cause being an architectural flaw. \nCacheWarp poses a threat to any system running on AMD processors that support\nSEV. However, the risk is specifically significant for users deploying secure\nvirtual machines using SEV. The underlying vulnerability, tracked as\nCVE-2023-20592, affects various AMD systems with SEV-enabled processors,\nincluding 1st and 2nd generation EPYC (SEV and SEV-ES), and 3rd generation EPYC\n(SEV, SEV-ES, SEV-SNP), but does not impact the 4th generation AMD EPYC Genoa\n(Zen 4). \nThe researchers have provided comprehensive documentation of their findings,\nlaunched a dedicated website to summarize the attack, and released a video\ndemonstrating CacheWarp gaining root privileges and bypassing OpenSSH\nauthentication to escalate to root via sudo. \nAMD has responded with a security advisory. While no mitigations are available\nfor 1st or 2nd generation EPYC processors, the company has released a microcode\nfix for 3rd generation AMD EPYC processors with SEV-SNP enabled, ensuring no\nperformance degradation as a result of the fix. \nIntel \nIntel has recently addressed a significant vulnerability present in its range of\nCPUs, including the newest Alder Lake, Raptor Lake, and Sapphire Rapids\nmicroarchitectures, which span desktop, server, mobile, and embedded platforms. \nThis vulnerability, cataloged as CVE-2023-23583, is identified as a redundant\nprefix issue. It has the potential to be exploited in several ways, such as\nescalating privileges, accessing sensitive information, or triggering a Denial\nof Service (DoS) condition, which could lead to substantial losses, especially\nfor cloud providers. Intel\u2019s investigation revealed that under certain\nconditions, the execution of the REP MOVSB instruction, if encoded with a\nredundant REX prefix, might cause unpredictable system behavior. This could lead\nto a system crash or freeze and, in limited scenarios, enable an elevation of\nprivilege (EoP) from CPL3 to CPL0. Intel assesses that the likelihood of this\nproblem occurring in any software is low, as redundant REX prefixes are\ngenerally not present in code and are not generated by compilers. Nevertheless,\nthe potential for malicious exploitation exists, requiring the execution of\narbitrary code. \nThis issue, also independently identified by several Google research groups and\ntermed \u2018Reptar,\u2019 involves the interpretation of redundant prefixes by CPUs.\nAccording to Phil Venables, VP and IS Director at Google Cloud, successful\nexploitation can bypass the security boundaries of the CPU, leading to unusual\nand problematic behavior. Systems equipped with vulnerable CPUs, including those\nbased on Alder Lake, Raptor Lake, and Sapphire Rapids architectures, have\nalready been updated with new microcode. Notably, these updates did not impact\nsystem performance. \nIntel has released microcode updates for other affected processors and strongly\nadvises users to update their BIOS, operating systems, and drivers to safeguard\nagainst this vulnerability. \n--\nLink: https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/patchmanagement/bc549e62-4d44-4a77-ad37-70305e375340n%40googlegroups.com \n", "evaluated_keywords": "['manage cloud service within virtual data centers', 'user deploy secure virtual machine use sev', 'secure file transfer across various device', 'attacker within close proximity could connect', 'significant software bug injection attack target amd sev', 'execute command via api request', 'popular password manager like 1password']", "evaluated_noun_chunks": "[\"Microsoft Access\", \"Google Chrome\", \"Mozilla Firefox\", \"Web Password Managers\", \"Action1 Vulnerability Digest\", \"real-time updates\", \"Atlassian: four critical vulnerabilities\"]", "post_type": "Solution provided", "unique_tokens": 1391, "product_build_ids": [], "thread_id": "december_patch_tuesday_vulns_analysis_action1", "previous_id": null, "next_id": "6d6f3ccc-0505-80f2-eedf-36cf15a2b8da", "etl_processing_status": {"document_processed": true, "entities_extracted": true, "graph_prepared": false, "vector_prepared": false, "last_processed_at": "2025-01-01T12:50:39.168430", "processing_version": "1.0"}, "noun_chunks": "[\"Microsoft Access\", \"Google Chrome\", \"Mozilla Firefox\", \"Web Password Managers\", \"Action1 Vulnerability Digest\", \"real-time updates\", \"Atlassian: four critical vulnerabilities\"]", "keywords": "['manage cloud service within virtual data centers', 'user deploy secure virtual machine use sev', 'secure file transfer across various device', 'attacker within close proximity could connect', 'significant software bug injection attack target amd sev', 'execute command via api request', 'popular password manager like 1password']", "node_label": "PatchManagementPost", "kb_ids": [], "cve_ids": "CVE-2022-1471 CVE-2023-5731 CVE-2023-5721 CVE-2023-6350 CVE-2023-37928 CVE-2023-49103 CVE-2023-45866 CVE-2023-6345 CVE-2023-41266 CVE-2023-43177 CVE-2023-42917 CVE-2023-45866 CVE-2023-23583 CVE-2023-5730 CVE-2023-4474 CVE-2023-49105 CVE-2023-34060 CVE-2023-6553 CVE-2023-36553 CVE-2023-41265 CVE-2023-20592 CVE-2023-43177 CVE-2023-34992 CVE-2023-20592 CVE-2023-36553 CVE-2023-6345 CVE-2023-42916 CVE-2023-20275 CVE-2023-35137 CVE-2023-22523 CVE-2023-20198 CVE-2023-2136 CVE-2023-6348 CVE-2023-22524 CVE-2023-20275 CVE-2023-4473 CVE-2023-20273 CVE-2023-6351 CVE-2023-49104 CVE-2023-48365 CVE-2023-6347 CVE-2023-6346 CVE-2023-37927 CVE-2023-35138 CVE-2023-49105 CVE-2023-6063 CVE-2023-41265 CVE-2023-23583 CVE-2023-49103 CVE-2023-42917 CVE-2023-22522", "build_numbers": [], "product_mentions": [], "is_processed": false}, "added_at": "2025-01-01T12:56:14.079437", "last_updated": "2025-01-01T12:58:07.766843"}
