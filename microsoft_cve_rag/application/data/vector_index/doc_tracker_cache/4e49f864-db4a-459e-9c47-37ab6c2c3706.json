{"tool_label": "MergeCIPolicyToRestrictCurlExecution", "description": "This tool allows administrators to create and manage Code Integrity Policies (CIP) to restrict the execution of specific versions of the curl.exe utility, which may be susceptible to vulnerabilities. Through the use of PowerShell cmdlets, such as 'merge-cipolicy', these policies can be combined with existing ones or newly created to ensure that vulnerable versions cannot be executed. Users can find detailed instructions and examples for deploying these policies in the Microsoft documentation, which provides robust guidance for IT professionals managing Windows environments.", "source_id": "7001567b-77d3-824e-62c4-9c022f0f7278", "source_type": "MSRCPost", "tags": ["security", "curl", "policy", "execution", "CIP"], "node_id": "4e49f864-db4a-459e-9c47-37ab6c2c3706", "tool_url": null, "metadata": {"source_url": "https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/deploying-wdac-policies", "node_label": "Tool", "reliability": 0.9, "severity_type": "important", "entity_type": "Tool", "synthesized_code": null}, "added_at": "2024-12-30T12:19:11.477660", "last_updated": "2024-12-30T12:19:11.477660"}
