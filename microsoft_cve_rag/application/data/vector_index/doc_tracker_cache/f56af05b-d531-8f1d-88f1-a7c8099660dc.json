We patch ~600 servers with it and it has been an\neasy-to-use tool and other than security concerns on other Ivanti products, have\nno real issue with it. \nWhat is this lists\u2019 thoughts on potential security issue with Ivanti Security\nControls and what other Windows patch management tools deserve a look? \nAll thoughts/comments welcome. \nDave \nAttention: Information contained in this message and or attachments is intended\nonly for the recipient(s) named above and may contain confidential and or\nprivileged material that is protected under State or Federal law.
