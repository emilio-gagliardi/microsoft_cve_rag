{"description": "**Fix Overview**:\n\nTo enhance security and mitigate similar breaches, it is crucial to implement two-factor authentication (2FA) across all user accounts and systems.\n\n1. Identify critical accounts and systems that require enhanced security measures.\n2. Enable 2FA for these accounts to add an additional layer of protection against unauthorized access.\n\n**Details**:\nImplementing 2FA helps to ensure that even if passwords are compromised, unauthorized users cannot gain access without the second form of authentication, which can be a mobile device or authentication app. This practice significantly reduces the risk of breaches, especially in environments that have previously experienced attacks due to weak security practices. (LLM Synthesized)\n\n**Preconditions**:\n- Ensure all users are trained on the importance of 2FA and how to set it up.\n- Verify that the systems support 2FA integrations.", "source_id": "8045c801-5897-827f-5ddb-8142a9afd141", "source_type": "PatchManagementPost", "fix_label": "ImplementTwoFactorAuthenticationForSecurity", "tags": ["2FA", "SecurityEnhancement", "AccessControl", "LLM Synthesized"], "node_id": "84386f04-4aca-49ba-8f57-9a16163204eb", "metadata": {"node_label": "Fix", "reliability": 0.7, "severity_type": "important", "entity_type": "Fix"}, "added_at": "2025-01-05T08:37:07.018296", "last_updated": "2025-01-05T08:37:07.018296"}
