Either: the attacker exploits the vulnerability by accessing the target system locally (e.g., keyboard, console), or remotely (e.g., SSH); or the attacker relies on User Interaction by another person to perform actions required to exploit the vulnerability (e.g., tricking a legitimate user into opening a malicious document) \nAttack Complexity \nThis metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker\u2019s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration. \nLow \nSpecialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success against the vulnerable component. \nPrivileges Required \n \nNone \nThe attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack. \nUser Interaction \n \nRequired \nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited. \nScope \n \nUnchanged \nAn exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority. \nConfidentiality \n \nHigh \nThere is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact. \nIntegrity \n \nHigh \nThere is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component. \nAvailability \n \nLow \nPerformance is reduced or there are interruptions in resource availability. Even if repeated exploitation of the vulnerability is possible, the attacker does not have the ability to completely deny service to legitimate users. The resources in the impacted component are either partially available all of the time, or fully available only some of the time, but overall there is no direct, serious consequence to the impacted component. \n\ue8ec \n\ue974 \nTemporal score metrics \n(3) \nExploit Code Maturity \nThis metric measures the likelihood of the vulnerability being attacked, and is typically based on the current state of exploit techniques, exploit code availability, or active, 'in-the-wild' exploitation. \nUnproven \nNo exploit code is available, or an exploit is theoretical. \nRemediation Level \n \nOfficial Fix \nA complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. \nReport Confidence \n \nConfirmed \nDetailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this). Source code is available to independently verify the assertions of the research, or the author or vendor of the affected code has confirmed the presence of the vulnerability. \nPlease see  \nCommon Vulnerability Scoring System \n for more information on the definition of these metrics. \nThe following table provides an  \nexploitability assessment \n for this vulnerability at the time of original publication. \nPublicly disclosed \nExploited \nExploitability assessment \nNo \nNo \nExploitation Less Likely \nAccording to the CVSS metric, the attack vector is local (AV:L). Why does the CVE title indicate that this is a remote code execution? \nThe word  \nRemote \n in the title refers to the location of the attacker. This type of exploit is sometimes referred to as Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE). The attack itself is carried out locally. \nFor example, when the score indicates that the  \nAttack Vector \n is  \nLocal \n and  \nUser Interaction \n is  \nRequired \n, this could describe an exploit in which an attacker, through social engineering, convinces a victim to download and open a specially crafted file from a website which leads to a local attack on their computer. \nAccording to the CVSS metric, successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to some loss of availability (A:L)? What does that mean for this vulnerability? \nThe performance can be interrupted and/or reduced, but the attacker cannot fully deny service. \nAccording to the CVSS metric, successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to some loss of integrity (I:L). What does that mean for this vulnerability? \nThe attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could have limited ability to perform code execution. \nWhat is the version information for this release? \nMicrosoft Edge Channel \nMicrosoft Edge Version \nDate Released \nBased on Chromium Version \nStable \n119.0.2151.58 \n11/09/2023 \n119.0.6045.123/.124 \nExtended Stable \n118.0.2088.102 \n11/09/2023 \n118.0.5993.136 \nHAO LI of VenusTech ADLab \nMicrosoft recognizes the efforts of those in the security community who help us protect customers through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

The vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. It is caused by a flaw in Microsoft Edge's Chromium-based engine. Successful exploitation could result in a total loss of confidentiality and integrity, as well as reduced availability. The attack vector is local, requiring user interaction, and the attack complexity is low, with no privileges required. Microsoft has released a security update for Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) versions 119.0.2151.58 and 118.0.2088.102 to address this vulnerability.
