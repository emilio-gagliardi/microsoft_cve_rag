{"symptom_label": "UefiSecureBootImageAssumptionError", "description": "The assumption that UEFI requires all entities involved in Secure Boot to be signed, including images, leads to potential system misconfigurations. This misunderstanding can introduce security risks, as unsigned images may be allowed to run unchecked, potentially undermining the integrity of the secure boot process. Administrators must ensure that their environments adhere to the correct configuration guidelines and understand the implications of image signing in UEFI setups.", "source_id": "4ba5d6e3-7e6d-506d-86bd-5153762ee077", "source_type": "PatchManagementPost", "tags": ["UEFI", "Secure Boot", "Configuration Management"], "node_id": "d6df4248-5ec8-4767-bb04-c0deac889f91", "metadata": {"node_label": "Symptom", "reliability": 0.85, "severity_type": "important", "entity_type": "Symptom"}, "added_at": "2024-12-31T15:11:01.491041", "last_updated": "2024-12-31T15:11:01.491041"}
