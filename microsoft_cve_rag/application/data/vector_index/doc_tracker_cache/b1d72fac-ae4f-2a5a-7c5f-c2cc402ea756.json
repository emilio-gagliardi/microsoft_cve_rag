This stops vulnerable Linux EFI (Shim bootloaders) from running. This SBAT update will not apply to systems that dual-boot Windows and Linux. After the SBAT update is applied, older Linux ISO images might not boot. If this occurs, work with your Linux vendor to get an updated ISO image. \nIf you installed earlier updates, only the new updates contained in this package will be downloaded and installed on your device. \nFor more information about security vulnerabilities, please refer to the new  \nSecurity Update Guide \n website and the  \nAugust 2024 Security Updates \n. \nWindows 10 servicing stack update (KB5041579)\u00a0- 19044.4769 and 19045.4769 \nThis update makes quality improvements to the servicing stack, which is the component that installs Windows updates.
