{"symptom_label": "VmsFailToStartAfterOctUpdateOn2019", "description": "After applying the October update on a Server 2019 development host, any virtual machines (VMs) imported using RCT files failed to start. This issue persisted until the November update was applied, at which point the VMs could be imported successfully without needing to manually remove the RCT files. Importantly, another development host updated directly from September to November showed no issues with the same imported RCT files, indicating that the problem was specific to the environment that received the October update.", "source_id": "848ff78f-003c-bdcd-de85-17d3da8319b4", "source_type": "PatchManagementPost", "tags": ["vmware", "server2019", "patchupdate"], "node_id": "a18643ed-e96d-48ef-add8-ab95be0be0b1", "metadata": {"node_label": "Symptom", "reliability": 0.85, "severity_type": "important", "entity_type": "Symptom"}, "added_at": "2024-12-30T14:37:21.927385", "last_updated": "2024-12-30T14:37:21.927385"}
