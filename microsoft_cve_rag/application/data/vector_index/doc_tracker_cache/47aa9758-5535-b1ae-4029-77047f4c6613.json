This is a 2012R2 server where we have successfully installed the September monthly rollup patch on 9/24/2023. However on 9/29/2023 this patch and about ten others were installed again and are pending a reboot to finish. Some of the other patches were successfully installed as far back as 2014. Checking with others in my department to see if a change or update in an application may have triggered this. Thought I'd post this to see if anyone has every had an issue like this before.
