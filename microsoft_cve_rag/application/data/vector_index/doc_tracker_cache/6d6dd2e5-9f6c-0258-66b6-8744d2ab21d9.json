Servicing stack updates (SSU) ensure that you have a robust and reliable servicing stack so that your devices can receive and install Microsoft updates. \nKnown issues in this update \nSymptom \nWorkaround \nWindows devices using more than one (1) monitor might experience issues with desktop icons moving unexpectedly between monitors or other icon alignment issues when attempting to use Copilot in Windows (in preview). \nTo prevent users from encountering this issue, Copilot in Windows (in preview)\u00a0might not be available on devices that have been used or are currently being used in a multimonitor configuration. \nWe are working on a resolution and will provide an update in an upcoming release. \nCopilot in Windows (in preview) is not currently supported when your taskbar is located vertically on the right or left of your screen. \nTo access Copilot in Windows, make sure your taskbar is positioned horizontally on the top or bottom of your screen. \nWe are working on a resolution and will provide an update in an upcoming release. \nAfter you install  \nKB5034203 \n\u00a0(dated 01/23/2024) or later updates, some Windows devices that use the  \nDHCP Option 235 \n to discover  \nMicrosoft Connected Cache (MCC) \n nodes in their network might be unable to use those nodes. Instead, these Windows devices will download updates and apps from the public internet. IT administrators also see increased download traffic on their internet routes. \nThose of you who use the Home edition of Windows are not likely to experience this issue. MCC and DHCP Option 235 are typically used in enterprise environments. \nOption \n1: \n Configure Microsoft Connected Cache endpoint in  \nDOCacheHost \n policy as indicated in  \nCache hostname \n. Additionally,  \nDOCacheHostSource \nhas to be set to  \n1 \nor removed as indicated in  \nCache hostname source \n. By default, the  \nDOCacheHost and DOCacheHostSource \n policies have no value. \nOption \n2: \n You can mitigate this issue using Group Policies available through our support channel. Organizations can request help at  \nSupport for business \n. \nWe are working on a resolution and will provide an update in an upcoming release. \nAfter installing this update, you might be unable to  \nchange your user account profile picture \n. \nWhen attempting to change a profile picture by selecting the button  \nStart \n>  \nSettings  \n> \n Account  \n> \n Your info \n and, under \n Create your picture \n, clicking on  \nBrowse for one,  \nyou might receive an error message with error code 0x80070520. \nWe are working on a resolution and will provide an update in an upcoming release. \nHow to get this update \nBefore you install this update \nMicrosoft now combines the latest servicing stack update (SSU) for your operating system with the latest cumulative update (LCU).\u00a0For general information about SSUs,\u00a0see  \nServicing stack updates \n\u00a0and\u00a0 \nServicing Stack Updates (SSU): Frequently Asked Questions \n. \nPrerequisite: \nBased on your installation scenario, choose one of the following: \nFor offline OS image servicing: \nIf your image does not have the\u00a0March 22, 2022 ( \nKB5011543 \n) or later LCU, you  \nmust  \ninstall the special standalone May 10, 2022 SSU ( \nKB5014032 \n) before installing this update. \nFor Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) deployment or when installing the standalone package from Microsoft Update Catalog: \nIf your devices do not have the May 11, 2021\u00a0( \nKB5003173 \n)\u00a0or later LCU, you  \nmust  \ninstall the special standalone August 10, 2021 SSU ( \nKB5005260 \n) before installing this update. \nInstall this update \nTo install this update, use one of the following Windows and Microsoft release channels. \nWindows Update \nBusiness \nCatalog \nServer Update Services \nAvailable \nNext Step \nYes \nNone.
