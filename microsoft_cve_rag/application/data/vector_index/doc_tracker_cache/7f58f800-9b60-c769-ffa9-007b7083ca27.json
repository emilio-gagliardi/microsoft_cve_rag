I understand when you install the October CU (in our case KB5031362) that the guest OS may not start and in such a situation you can delete two files which will allow the guest OS to start up again. What I am trying to figure out are the following What OS\u2019s are affect? I have been seeing 2022 and 2019. Is 2016 effected by this? Does this happen all the time? What if you are in a cluster. I have seen that this does not effect a cluster? What versions of ESXi if any does it affect if you are running on a ESXi Host. I have read 7 and under. Veeam told me that after removing the two files, next time you reboot the same problem will happen and you will have to delete the files again. I found in another place that is not true. There is so much out there that there does not appear to be any consistent answer.
