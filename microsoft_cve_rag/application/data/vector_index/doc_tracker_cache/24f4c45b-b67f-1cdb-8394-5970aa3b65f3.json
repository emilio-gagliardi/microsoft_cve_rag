You might not find a speech model that matches your display language. You can still use voice access in English (US). You can always choose a different language from  \nSettings \n >  \nLanguage \n on the voice access bar. \nNew! \nYou can now use all voice access features on multiple displays. These include number and grid overlays that, in the past, you could only use on the primary display. While you are using the grid overlay on a screen, you can quickly switch to another display. To do that, use the alphabet or  \nNATO phonetic \n in your command. For example, \u201cB\u201d or \u201cBravo\u201d are both valid for the display that is assigned that letter. \nYou can also use the \u201cmouse grid\u201d command to quickly move your mouse to a specific point on a display. For example, in the screenshot below, the command will be, \u201cmouse grid A 114.\u201d Finally, you can use the drag and drop feature to move files, apps, and documents from one display to another. \nNew! \nThis update introducesvoice shortcuts or custom commands. You can use them to create your own commands in the supported English dialects. To start, say \u201cwhat can I say\u201d and click the \u201cVoice shortcuts\u201d tab on the left panel. You can also use the command \u201cshow voice shortcuts\u201d to open the Voice shortcuts page. Click  \nCreate new shortcut \n. Use your voice or other input to create a command. Give it a name and select one or more actions. After you fill in the necessary information, click  \nCreate \n. Your command is now ready to use. To view all the voice shortcuts you have created, go to the command help page or use the voice command, \u201cshow voice shortcuts.\u201d \nNarrator \nNew! \nYou can now listen to a preview of the ten natural voices before you download them. See the Narrator section of the  \nSeptember 2023 update \n for the list. These voices use  \nmodern \n, on-device text-to-speech. Once you download them, they work without an internet connection. However, to listen to a preview, you need an internet connection. To add and use one of the natural voices, follow the steps below. \nTo open Narrator settings, press the WIN+CTRL+N hotkey. \nUnder Narrator\u2019s voice, select  \nAdd \n, which is next to  \nAdd natural voices \n. \nSelect the voice you want to install. You can install all voices, but you must install them one at a time. \nThe preview will play automatically as you browse the list. \nIf you like the preview, click  \nDownload and Install \n. The new voice downloads and is ready for use in a few minutes, depending on your internet download speed. \nIn Narrator settings, select your preferred voice from the menu in  \nNarrator\u2019s voice \n >  \nChoose a voice \n. \nNew! \nThis update adds a new keyboard command to move between the images on a screen. Now, you can use the keys G or Shift+G to move forward or backward between images in Scan mode (Narrator key+space bar). \nNew! \nThis update improves Narrator\u2019s detection of text in images, which includes handwriting. It also improves the descriptions of images. To use this feature, you must have an active internet connection. You must also turn on the setting to get image descriptions in Narrator settings. To try this experience, select an image and press the Narrator key+CTRL+D. \nNew! \nIn Microsoft Word, Narrator will announce the presence of bookmarks and draft or resolved comments. It also tells you if accessibility suggestions exist when it reads text in the file. \nNew! \nYou can now use voice access to open applications, dictate text, and interact with elements on the screen. You can also use your voice to command Narrator. For example, you can tell it to, \u201cspeak faster,\u201d \u201cread next line,\u201d and so on. To get started, search for \u201cvoice access\u201d in Windows search and set it up. \nWindows share \nNew! \nThis update changes the apps that appear in the Windows share window. The account you use to sign in affects the apps that are in \u201cShare using.\u201d For example, if you use a Microsoft account (MSA) to sign in, you will see Microsoft Teams (free). When you use a Microsoft Entra ID account (formerly Azure Active Directory) to sign in, your Microsoft Teams (work or school) contacts show instead. \nNew! \nThe Windows share window now supports sharing with WhatsApp in the \u201cShare using\u201d section. If you do not have WhatsApp installed, you can install it from the Windows share window. \nNearby Share \nNew! \nThis update affects how Nearby Share turns on and off. You can use quick settings or the Settings app to turn on Nearby Share. If you do and Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are off, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth will turn on to make Nearby Share work as you expect. If you turn off Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, Nearby Share turns off as well. \nNew! \nThis update improves Nearby Share transfer speed for users on the same network.

Right-click a local file in File Explorer and choose \u201cShare.\u201d Then choose to share to a device listed in Nearby Share in the Windows share window. \nNew! \nYou can now give your device a more friendly name to identify it when sharing. Go to  \nSettings \n >  \nSystem \n >  \nNearby sharing \n. There, you can rename your device. \nCasting \nNew! \nThis update helps you to learn about the Cast feature and discover when it is available; see the examples in the list below. To cast means to send content that is on your device\u2019s screen to a nearby PC, TV, or other external displays. This happens wirelessly. \nYou might often switch between windows to complete a task or use  \nSnap Assist \n to organize your screen space. When you multitask like this, a notification will suggest that you use Cast. \nThe Cast flyout menu in quick settings gives you more help to find nearby displays, fix connections, and more. \nSnap Layouts \nNew! \nThis update adds suggestions to \u202f \nSnap Layouts \n.\u202f They help you to instantly snap multiple app windows together. \nNew! \nYou can hover over the minimize or maximize button of an app (WIN+Z) to open the layout box.
