On your\nWindows 11 I'll bet BOTH recovery partitions are not in use. \n[cid:emfc7e21fb-130e-41a7-a0a1-c65e8fe62e8e@d44197a6.com] \nMy actual recovery partition in use is number 4 \n[cid:eme01260fd-5736-4927-9ca9-6e8708df977e@d44197a6.com] \nSo step one - which partition - if any - is in use?\u00a0 reagentc /info is your\nfriend\nStep two use minitool partition wizard free to see how REALLY free that\npartition is and what are your options for resizing\nLink: https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/patchmanagement/CH3PR02MB968972EDC3B5E971E0EF6DF4A6722%40CH3PR02MB9689.namprd02.prod.outlook.com \n", "evaluated_keywords": "['information technology group mcandrews', 'privileged information', 'hardware guy', 'confidentiality notice']", "evaluated_noun_chunks": "['my hardware guy', 'Manager, Information Technology Group', 'confidential and privileged information', 'Your cooperation']", "post_type": "Conversational", "unique_tokens": 82, "product_build_ids": [], "cve_ids": null, "etl_processing_status": {"document_processed": true, "entities_extracted": true, "graph_prepared": true, "vector_prepared": true, "last_processed_at": "2025-01-03T16:42:10.732257", "processing_version": "1.0"}, "is_processed": true, "next_id": "7efe0285-cf19-c14a-d906-92a5801c259f", "previous_id": "eadd613f-dab7-232f-ef48-d68ece7715c0", "product_mentions": [], "thread_id": "feedback_microsoft", "build_numbers": [], "kb_ids": [], "noun_chunks": "['my hardware guy', 'Manager, Information Technology Group', 'confidential and privileged information', 'Your cooperation']", "keywords": "['information technology group mcandrews', 'privileged information', 'hardware guy', 'confidentiality notice']", "node_label": "PatchManagementPost"}, "added_at": "2025-01-03T16:35:59.332089", "last_updated": "2025-01-04T21:07:56.779691"}
