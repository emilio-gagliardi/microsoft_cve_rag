Servicing stack updates (SSU) ensure that you have a robust and reliable servicing stack so that your devices can receive and install Microsoft updates. \nKnown issues in this update \nClick or tap to view the known issues \nSymptom \nWorkaround \nDevices with Windows installations created from custom offline media or custom ISO image might have  \nMicrosoft Edge Legacy \n removed by this update, but not automatically replaced by the new Microsoft Edge. This issue is only encountered when custom offline media or ISO images are created by slipstreaming this update into the image without having first installed the standalone servicing stack update (SSU) released March 29, 2021 or later. \nNote  \nDevices that connect directly to Windows Update to receive updates are not affected. This includes devices using Windows Update for Business. Any device connecting to Windows Update should always receive the latest versions of the SSU and latest cumulative update (LCU) without any extra steps. \nTo avoid this issue, be sure to first slipstream the SSU released March 29, 2021 or later into the custom offline media or ISO image before slipstreaming the LCU. To do this with the combined SSU and LCU packages now used for Windows 10, version 20H2 and Windows 10, version 2004, you will need to extract the SSU from the combined package. Use the following steps to extract the SSU: \nExtract the cab from the msu via this command line (using the package for KB5000842 as an example):  \nexpand Windows10.0-KB5000842-x64.msu /f:Windows10.0-KB5000842-x64.cab <destination path> \nExtract the SSU from the previously extracted cab via this command line:  \nexpand Windows10.0-KB5000842-x64.cab /f:* <destination path> \nYou will then have the SSU cab, in this example named  \nSSU-19041.903-x64.cab \n. Slipstream this file into your offline image first, then the LCU. \nIf you have already encountered this issue by installing the OS using affected custom media, you can mitigate it by directly installing the  \nnew Microsoft Edge \n. If you need to broadly deploy the new Microsoft Edge for business, see  \nDownload and deploy Microsoft Edge for business \n. \nUsing the  \nFixedDrivesEncryptionType \n or  \nSystemDrivesEncryptionType \n policy settings in the  \nBitLocker configuration service provider (CSP) \n node in mobile device management (MDM) apps might incorrectly show a 65000 error in the \"Require Device Encryption\" setting for some devices in your environment. Affected environments are those with the \u201cEnforce drive encryption type on operating system drives\u201d or \"Enforce drive encryption on fixed drives\" policies set to enabled and selecting either \"full encryption\" or \"used space only\". Microsoft Intune is affected by this issue but third-party MDMs might also pe affected. \nImportant \n This issue is a reporting issue only and does not affect drive encryption or the reporting of other issues on the device, including other BitLocker issues. \nThis issue is addressed in  \nKB5034203 \n. \nHow to get this update \nBefore installing this update \nMicrosoft now combines the latest servicing stack update (SSU) for your operating system with the latest cumulative update (LCU).\u00a0For general information about SSUs,\u00a0see  \nServicing stack updates \n\u00a0and\u00a0 \nServicing Stack Updates (SSU): Frequently Asked Questions \n. \nPrerequisite: \nBased on your installation scenario, choose one of the following: \nFor offline OS image servicing: \nIf your image does not have the\u00a0March 22, 2022 ( \nKB5011543 \n) or later LCU, you  \nmust  \ninstall the special standalone May 10, 2022 SSU ( \nKB5014032 \n) before installing this update. \nFor Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) deployment or when installing the standalone package from Microsoft Update Catalog: \nIf your devices do not have the May 11, 2021\u00a0( \nKB5003173 \n)\u00a0or later LCU, you  \nmust  \ninstall the special standalone August 10, 2021 SSU ( \nKB5005260 \n) before installing this update. \nInstall this update \nRelease Channel \nAvailable \nNext Step \nWindows Update and Microsoft Update \nYes \nNone. This update will be downloaded and installed automatically from Windows Update. \nWindows Update for Business \nYes \nNone. This update will be downloaded and installed automatically from Windows Update in accordance with configured policies. \nMicrosoft Update Catalog \nYes \nTo get the standalone package for this update, go to the\u00a0 \nMicrosoft Update Catalog \n\u00a0website. \nWindows Server Update Services (WSUS) \nYes \nThis update will automatically sync\u00a0with WSUS if you configure  \nProducts and Classifications \n as follows: \nProduct \n: Windows 10, version 1903 and later \nClassification \n: Security Updates \nIf you want to remove the LCU \nTo remove the LCU after installing the combined SSU and LCU package, use the  \nDISM/Remove-Package \n command line option with the LCU package name as the argument.
