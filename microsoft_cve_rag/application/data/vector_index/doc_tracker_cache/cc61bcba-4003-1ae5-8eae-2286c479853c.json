Learn why this is\nimportant [https://aka.ms/LearnAboutSenderIdentification] \nHi, \nYeah, that is my concern. Supply-chain attacks taking advantage of the\ndemonstrated poor security practices in that company. \nYou all talk about funcitonality, but you are pushing patches packaged by Ivanti\nor somebody's else like Chocolatey: Do you trust them? Are you unpackaging every\npatch and analyzing what is inside of all deployment scripts? Are you blindly\ninstalling software from Ivanti or any other automated patching tool using an\nonline repository of prepackaged patches? \nIt is eventually a matter of trust. Security vs Convenience. \nBest regards. \nSeve \nVon: 'Dave Lum' via PatchManagement <patchmanagement@googlegroups.com>\nGesendet: Montag, 12.
