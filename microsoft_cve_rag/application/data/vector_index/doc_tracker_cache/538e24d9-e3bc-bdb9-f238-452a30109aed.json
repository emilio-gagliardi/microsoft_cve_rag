When you install this KB: \nThis update addresses an issue that affects remote direct memory access (RDMA) performance counters. They do\u00a0not return networking data on VMs in the right way. \nThis update addresses an issue that affects  \nfontdrvhost.exe \n. It stops responding when you use Compact Font Format version 2 (CFF2) fonts. \nThis update addresses a memory leak in  \nctfmon.exe \n. \nThis update addresses a memory leak in  \nTextInputHost.exe \n. \nThis update affects Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) Secure Boot systems. It adds a renewed signing certificate to the Secure Boot DB variable. You can now opt for this change.\u00a0For more details, see  \nKB5036210 \n. \nThis update addresses an issue that affects the download of device metadata. Downloads from the Windows Metadata and Internet Services (WMIS) over HTTPS are now more secure. \nThis update addresses an issue that affects the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS). It might stop working. This occurs when you access the Active Directory database. \nThis update addresses an issue that affects Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC). Its \u201callow\u201d policies might block some binaries from running. \nThis update addresses an issue that affects the Certificate Authority snap-in. You cannot select the \"Delta CRL\" option. This stops you from using the GUI to publish Delta CRLs. \nThis update changes a setting in Active Directory Users & Computers. By default, the snap-in now uses a strong certificate mapping of X509IssuerSerialNumber. It does not use the weak mapping of x509IssuerSubject. \nIf you installed earlier updates, only the new updates contained in this package will be downloaded and installed on your device. \nFor more information about security vulnerabilities, please refer to the  \nSecurity Update Guide \n website and the  \nFebruary 2024 Security Updates \n. \nWindows 11\u00a0servicing stack update - 22000.2770 \nThis update makes quality improvements to the servicing stack, which is the component that installs Windows updates.
