Servicing stack updates (SSU) ensure that you have a robust and reliable servicing stack so that your devices can receive and install Microsoft updates. \nKnown issues in this update\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b \nApplies to \nSymptom \nWorkaround \nAll users \nFollowing the installation of the October 2024 security update, some customers report that the OpenSSH\u00a0(Open Secure Shell) service fails to start, preventing SSH connections. The service fails with no detailed logging, and manual intervention is required to run the sshd.exe process. \nThis issue is affecting both enterprise, IOT, and education customers, with a limited number of devices impacted. Microsoft is investigating whether consumer customers using Home or Pro editions of Windows are affected. \nCustomers can temporarily resolve the issue by updating permissions (ACLs) on the affected directories. Follow these steps: \nOpen PowerShell as an Administrator. \nUpdate the permissions for C:\\ProgramData\\ssh and C:\\ProgramData\\ssh\\logs to allow full control for SYSTEM and the Administrators group, while allowing read access for Authenticated Users. You can restrict read access to specific users or groups by modifying the permissions string if needed. \nUse the following commands to update the permissions: \n$directoryPath = \"C:\\ProgramData\\ssh\" $acl = Get-Acl -Path $directoryPath $sddlString = \"O:BAD:PAI(A;OICI;FA;;;SY)(A;OICI;FA;;;BA)(A;OICI;0x1200a9;;;AU)\" $securityDescriptor = New-Object System.Security.AccessControl.RawSecurityDescriptor $sddlString $acl.SetSecurityDescriptorSddlForm($securityDescriptor.GetSddlForm(\"All\")) Set-Acl -Path $directoryPath -AclObject $acl \nRepeat the above steps for C:\\ProgramData\\ssh\\logs. \nMicrosoft is actively investigating the issue and will provide a resolution in an upcoming Windows update. Further communications will be provided when a resolution or additional workarounds are available. \nHow to get this update \nBefore you install this update \nMicrosoft combines the latest servicing stack update (SSU) for your operating system with the latest cumulative update (LCU).\u00a0For general information about SSUs,\u00a0see  \nServicing stack updates \n\u00a0and\u00a0 \nServicing Stack Updates (SSU): Frequently Asked Questions \n. \nInstall this update \nTo install this update, use one of the following Windows and Microsoft release channels. \nWindows Update \nBusiness \nCatalog \nServer Update Services \nAvailable \nNext Step \nYes \nNone.
