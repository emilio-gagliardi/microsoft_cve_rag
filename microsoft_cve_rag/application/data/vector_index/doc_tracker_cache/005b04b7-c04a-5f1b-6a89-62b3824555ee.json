Specific CVE on the portal CVE-2023-44487 - Security Update Guide - Microsoft - MITRE: CVE-2023-44487 HTTP/2 Rapid Reset Attack\n Doesn't say anything per se about these registry keys - I guess because they are linked? he following workarounds\n might be helpful in your situation. In all cases, Microsoft strongly recommends that you install the updates for this vulnerability as soon as possible even if you plan to leave either of these workarounds in place: Disable the HTTP/2 protocol on your web server by using the Registry Editor Note Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the \"Changing Keys and Values\" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the \"Add and Delete Information in the Registry\" and \"Edit Registry Data\" Help topics in Regedt32.exe. 1.
