{"symptom_label": "WindowsUpdateFailsDueToInsufficientRecoveryPartition", "description": "A recent Microsoft update fails to install on Windows 10 systems due to the absence of a recovery partition. This situation can arise if the recovery partition is either too small, misconfigured in relation to the drive, or completely missing. In contrast, the update installs successfully on Windows 11 systems, indicating a potential discrepancy in the recovery partition requirements across different builds or OS configurations.
