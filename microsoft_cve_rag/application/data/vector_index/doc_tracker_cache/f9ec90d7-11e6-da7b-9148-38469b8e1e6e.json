Either: the attacker exploits the vulnerability by accessing the target system locally (e.g., keyboard, console), or remotely (e.g., SSH); or the attacker relies on User Interaction by another person to perform actions required to exploit the vulnerability (e.g., tricking a legitimate user into opening a malicious document) \nAttack Complexity \nThis metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker\u2019s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration. \nLow \nSpecialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success against the vulnerable component. \nPrivileges Required \n \nLow \nThe attacker is authorized with (i.e., requires) privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges may have the ability to cause an impact only to non-sensitive resources. \nUser Interaction \n \nRequired \nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited. \nScope \n \nUnchanged \nAn exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority. \nConfidentiality \n \nHigh \nThere is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact. \nIntegrity \n \nHigh \nThere is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component. \nAvailability \n \nHigh \nThere is total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable). \n\ue8ec \n\ue974 \nTemporal score metrics \n(3) \nExploit Code Maturity \nThis metric measures the likelihood of the vulnerability being attacked, and is typically based on the current state of exploit techniques, exploit code availability, or active, 'in-the-wild' exploitation. \nUnproven \nNo exploit code is available, or an exploit is theoretical. \nRemediation Level \n \nOfficial Fix \nA complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. \nReport Confidence \n \nConfirmed \nDetailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this). Source code is available to independently verify the assertions of the research, or the author or vendor of the affected code has confirmed the presence of the vulnerability. \nPlease see  \nCommon Vulnerability Scoring System \n for more information on the definition of these metrics. \nThe following table provides an  \nexploitability assessment \n for this vulnerability at the time of original publication. \nPublicly disclosed \nExploited \nExploitability assessment \nNo \nNo \nExploitation Less Likely \nAccording to the CVSS metric, the attack vector is local (AV:L). Why does the CVE title indicate that this is a remote code execution? \nThe word  \nRemote \n in the title refers to the location of the attacker. This type of exploit is sometimes referred to as Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE). The attack itself is carried out locally. This means an attacker or victim needs to execute code from the local machine to exploit the vulnerability. \nAccording to the CVSS metric, user interaction is required (UI:R) and privileges required is Low (PR:L). What does that mean for this vulnerability? \nAn authorized attacker with guest privileges must send a victim a malicious site and convince them to open it. \nMicrosoft Offensive Research & Security Engineering with Microsoft \nMicrosoft recognizes the efforts of those in the security community who help us protect customers through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.
