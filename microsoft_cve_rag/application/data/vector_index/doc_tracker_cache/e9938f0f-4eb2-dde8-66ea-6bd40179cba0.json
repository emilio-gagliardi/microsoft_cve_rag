This is an informational change only. \nMicrosoft Remote Registry Service Remote Code Execution Vulnerability \nOn this page \n\ue70d \nCVE-2023-36423 \nSecurity Vulnerability \nReleased: Nov 14, 2023 Last updated: Nov 16, 2023 \nAssigning CNA: \nMicrosoft \nCVE-2023-36423  \n\uf35f \nImpact: Remote Code Execution \nMax Severity: Important \nCVSS:3.1 8.8 / 7.7 \n\ue946 \nBase score metrics: 8.8 / Temporal score metrics: 7.7 \nBase score metrics: 8.8 / Temporal score metrics: 7.7 \n\ue96e \nExpand all \n\ue970 \nCollapse all \nMetric \nValue \n\ue8ec \n\ue974 \nBase score metrics \n(8) \nAttack Vector \n \nNetwork \nThe vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers). \nAttack Complexity \nThis metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker\u2019s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration. \nLow \nSpecialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success against the vulnerable component. \nPrivileges Required \n \n.\n Low \nThe attacker is authorized with (i.e., requires) privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges may have the ability to cause an impact only to non-sensitive resources. \nUser Interaction \n \nNone \nThe vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user. \nScope \n \nUnchanged \nAn exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority. \nConfidentiality \n \nHigh \nThere is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact. \nIntegrity \n \nHigh \nThere is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component. \nAvailability \nThis metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). \n.\n Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component. \nHigh \nThere is total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable). \n\ue8ec \n\ue974 \nTemporal score metrics \n(3) \nExploit Code Maturity \nThis metric measures the likelihood of the vulnerability being attacked, and is typically based on the current state of exploit techniques, exploit code availability, or active, 'in-the-wild' exploitation. \nUnproven \nNo exploit code is available, or an exploit is theoretical. \nRemediation Level \n \nOfficial Fix \nA complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. \nReport Confidence \nThis metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. \n.\n This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers. \nConfirmed \nDetailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this). Source code is available to independently verify the assertions of the research, or the author or vendor of the affected code has confirmed the presence of the vulnerability. \nPlease see  \nCommon Vulnerability Scoring System \n for more information on the definition of these metrics. \nThe following table provides an  \nexploitability assessment \n for this vulnerability at the time of original publication. \nPublicly disclosed \nExploited \nExploitability assessment \nNo \nNo \nExploitation Less Likely \nAccording to the CVSS metric, privileges required is low (PR:L).  What does that mean for this vulnerability? \nAny authenticated attacker could trigger this vulnerability. It does not require admin or other elevated privileges. \nHow could an attacker exploit this vulnerability? \nA remote, authenticated attacker who is on the domain could exploit an out of bounds write vulnerability within regsvc to execute arbitrary code on the server. \nk0shl \n with  \nKunlun Lab \nMicrosoft recognizes the efforts of those in the security community who help us protect customers through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

The vulnerability allows a remote, authenticated attacker to exploit an out-of-bounds write vulnerability within regsvc to execute arbitrary code on the server. The attack vector is through the network, with low attack complexity and no user interaction required. The impact includes high confidentiality, integrity, and availability loss. Microsoft has provided security updates for various affected products, including Windows Server 2012, 2016, 2019, Windows 10, 11, and others, addressing the remote code execution vulnerability. System administrators are advised to apply the security updates to mitigate the risk of exploitation. The privileges required for the vulnerability are low, meaning any authenticated attacker could trigger it without admin or other elevated privileges.
