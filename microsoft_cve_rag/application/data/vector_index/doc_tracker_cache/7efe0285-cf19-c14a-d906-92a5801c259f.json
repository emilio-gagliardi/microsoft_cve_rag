On your\nWindows 11 I'll bet BOTH recovery partitions are not in use. \n[cid:image004.png@01DA4965.603C73B0] \nMy actual recovery partition in use is number 4 \n[cid:image005.png@01DA4965.603C73B0] \nSo step one - which partition - if any - is in use?\u00a0 reagentc /info is your\nfriend \nStep two use minitool partition wizard free to see how REALLY free that\npartition is and what are your options for resizing\nLink: https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/patchmanagement/004001da49a8%24b0d678f0%2412836ad0%24%40gmail.com \n", "evaluated_keywords": "['map user desktop', 'recovery partition \u2026', 'department also', 'thing like picture']", "evaluated_noun_chunks": "['a wipe', 'a recovery partition', 'users desktops', 'all departments']", "post_type": "Conversational", "unique_tokens": 34, "product_build_ids": [], "cve_ids": null, "etl_processing_status": {"document_processed": true, "entities_extracted": true, "graph_prepared": true, "vector_prepared": true, "last_processed_at": "2025-01-03T16:42:10.802098", "processing_version": "1.0"}, "is_processed": true, "next_id": "ef3a5f1b-c88d-758c-318e-cff0728b5eae", "previous_id": "801d61d4-94d6-e015-48c6-1663ee2356ef", "product_mentions": [], "thread_id": "feedback_microsoft", "build_numbers": [], "kb_ids": [], "noun_chunks": "['a wipe', 'a recovery partition', 'users desktops', 'all departments']", "keywords": "['map user desktop', 'recovery partition \u2026', 'department also', 'thing like picture']", "node_label": "PatchManagementPost"}, "added_at": "2025-01-03T16:36:01.661570", "last_updated": "2025-01-04T21:07:59.190411"}
