After you install this update, the UAC will prompt for them. Because of this, you must update your automation scripts. Application owners must add the Shield icon. It indicates that the process requires full administrator access. To turn off the UAC prompt, set the  \nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Installer\\DisableLUAInRepair \n registry value to  \n1 \n. The changes in this update might affect automatic Windows Installer repairs; see  \nApplication Resiliency: Unlock the Hidden Features of Windows Installer \n. \nIf you installed earlier updates, only the new updates contained in this package will be downloaded and installed on your device. \nFor more information about security vulnerabilities, please refer to the  \nSecurity Update Guide \n website and the  \nSeptember 2024 Security Updates \n. \nWindows 11\u00a0servicing stack update (KB5043937) - 22621.4166 and 22631.4166 \nThis update makes quality improvements to the servicing stack, which is the component that installs Windows updates. Servicing stack updates (SSU) ensure that you have a robust and reliable servicing stack so that your devices can receive and install Microsoft updates. \nKnown issues in this update\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b \nApplies to \nSymptom \nWorkaround \nAll users \nAfter installing this security update, you might face issues with booting Linux if you have enabled the dual-boot setup for Windows and Linux in your device. Resulting from this issue, your device might fail to boot Linux and show the error message \u201cVerifying shim SBAT data failed: Security Policy Violation. Something has gone seriously wrong: SBAT self-check failed: Security Policy Violation.\u201d \nThe August 2024 Windows security update applies a Secure Boot Advanced Targeting (SBAT) setting to devices that run Windows to block old, vulnerable boot managers. This SBAT update will not be applied to devices where dual booting is detected. On some devices, the dual-boot detection did not detect some customized methods of dual-booting and applied the SBAT value when it should not have been applied. \nPlease refer to the workaround mentioned in Windows release health site for this issue. \nHow to get this update \nBefore you install this update \nMicrosoft combines the latest servicing stack update (SSU) for your operating system with the latest cumulative update (LCU).\u00a0For general information about SSUs,\u00a0see  \nServicing stack updates \n\u00a0and\u00a0 \nServicing Stack Updates (SSU): Frequently Asked Questions \n. \nInstall this update \nTo install this update, use one of the following Windows and Microsoft release channels. \nWindows Update \nBusiness \nCatalog \nServer Update Services \nAvailable \nNext Step \nYes \nNone.

This update addresses high-impact vulnerabilities associated with User Account Control (UAC) behavior during application repairs and introduces quality improvements, including improved servicing stack capabilities. Home and Pro editions of Windows 11 version 22H2 will reach end of service on October 8, 2024, and will only receive security updates thereafter. Special installation requirements include prerequisites regarding dual-boot setups and necessary registry modifications to disable the UAC prompt during application repairs.\n\n**Technical Breakdown**\n\n**Vulnerabilities and Exploits**:\n- This update addresses high-impact vulnerabilities in the Windows Installer, specifically concerning the User Account Control (UAC) prompts that may affect automation scripts for application repairs.\n\n**Registry Changes**:\nTo modify the UAC behavior for Windows Installer, set the following registry key:\n```\n[Registry Key]\n`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Installer\\DisableLUAInRepair` = `1`\n```\n\n**Known Issues**:\n- Linux Boot Issues:\n  - Symptom: Dual-boot setups with Linux may prevent the Linux OS from booting, leading to a \u201cSecurity Policy Violation\u201d error.\n  - Workaround: Refer to the workaround detailed in the Microsoft release health site for specific dual-boot configurations.\n\n**Installation Process and Prerequisites**:\n1. Ensure devices are running the appropriate OS builds (22621.4169 or 22631.4169).\n2. Update to the latest servicing stack update (SSU) via:\n   - Windows Update\n   - Windows Update for Business\n   - Microsoft Update Catalog for standalone installation\n   - WSUS configured for \u201cWindows 11\u201d under the \u201cSecurity Updates\u201d classification.\n3. To remove the LCU, use the following command:\n```\n[Powershell]\n```powershell\nDISM /online /get-packages\nDISM /Remove-Package /PackageName:<PACKAGE_NAME>\n```\n   - Note: The DISM command must specify the exact LCU package name obtained from the previous command. The `wusa.exe` uninstall method will not work for combined packages.\n\n", "metadata": {"product_build_ids": ["9bde9f05-1edd-9934-cf2d-82c85c750723", "9211a6b9-7d5c-85b6-90d3-914240a5a43f", "a94bc749-c1f8-7046-70fd-e9e45ef2010c", "572ff072-33ca-04cf-80ab-2354fa5996ac", "24a079ed-b092-42f2-474d-4a6cfd8e3a02", "b3950f7d-0232-8ace-1641-5dde607ace77"], "cve_ids": ["CVE-2024-21416", "CVE-2024-30073", "CVE-2024-38014", "CVE-2024-38045", "CVE-2024-38046", "CVE-2024-38119", "CVE-2024-38217", "CVE-2024-38234", "CVE-2024-38235", "CVE-2024-38237", "CVE-2024-38238", "CVE-2024-38239", "CVE-2024-38240", "CVE-2024-38241", "CVE-2024-38242", "CVE-2024-38243", "CVE-2024-38244", "CVE-2024-38245", "CVE-2024-38246", "CVE-2024-38247", "CVE-2024-38248", "CVE-2024-38249", "CVE-2024-38250", "CVE-2024-38252", "CVE-2024-38253", "CVE-2024-38254", "CVE-2024-38257", "CVE-2024-38259", "CVE-2024-43461"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": null, "node_label": "KBArticle", "update_package_url": "https://catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=KB5043076", "etl_processing_status": {"document_processed": true, "entities_extracted": false, "graph_prepared": false, "vector_prepared": false, "last_processed_at": null, "processing_version": "1.0"}}, "added_at": "2025-02-01T22:05:18.785571", "last_updated": "2025-02-01T22:05:18.785571"}
