{"tool_label": "CheckAdobeInstallationUsingPowerShell", "description": "This PowerShell script checks for the installation of Adobe applications on both 64-bit and 32-bit versions of Windows. It first evaluates whether the operating system is 64-bit and searches the registry for installed Adobe software in the configurations relevant to 64-bit applications. If no 64-bit installation is found, it will then check the 32-bit registry path for any Adobe installations. The script uses `Get-ItemProperty` to retrieve details from the Windows registry and provides user-friendly output indicating whether the applications are found or not. This script is practical for system administrators who need to verify the presence of Adobe installations for compliance or troubleshooting purposes.", "source_id": "edb92902-4528-5e91-76fa-65d2f2ddb759", "source_type": "PatchManagementPost", "tool_url": "https://www.powershellgallery.com/", "tags": ["PowerShell", "Adobe", "Registry", "Software Check"], "node_id": "8b4edb95-fda1-4775-937b-f5099b303497", "metadata": {"source_url": "//groups.google.com/d/msgid/patchmanagement/CAOsGbKRwrRC12yptJQOUO3HRq-VcXCGeVct2966hoEfvqZd%3Dyg%40mail.gmail.com", "node_label": "Tool", "reliability": "0.9", "severity_type": "moderate", "entity_type": "Tool", "synthesized_code": null}, "added_at": "2024-12-30T14:37:52.827505", "last_updated": "2024-12-30T14:37:52.827505"}
