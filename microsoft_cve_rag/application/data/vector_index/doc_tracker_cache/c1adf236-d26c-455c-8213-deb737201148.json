{"tool_label": "ReagentCCommand", "description": "**Tool Overview**:\n\nThe ReagentC command is a built-in Windows utility used to manage the Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE). It can be utilized to set, disable, or enable the recovery image of Windows on a specified partition. This command is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to patch the winre.wim image from an ISO, allowing for restoration after a failure. To set a new recovery image, you would use the command `reagentc /setreimage` followed by the path to the custom recovery image. In security contexts, disabling WinRE can also minimize exposure to vulnerabilities linked to recovery features.\n\n***Usage Example***:\n\n```cmd\nreagentc /setreimage /path C:\newRecoveryImage\n```\nThis command sets the path for the recovery image to a new location, thus allowing customization of the recovery options.\n\nOverall, this Tool aids in configuring the recovery environment appropriately while addressing potential security concerns by managing recovery features efficiently.", "source_id": "37460973-92ed-f031-b8c9-eb949242e323", "source_type": "PatchManagementPost", "tool_url": "https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/reAgentC-commands", "tags": ["Windows", "Recovery", "Command-Line Utility", "ReagentC", "Security"], "node_id": "c1adf236-d26c-455c-8213-deb737201148", "metadata": {"source_ids": null, "source_url": "N/A", "node_label": "Tool", "reliability": 0.8, "severity_type": "important", "entity_type": "Tool"}, "added_at": "2025-01-04T19:59:06.169107", "last_updated": "2025-01-04T19:59:06.169107"}
