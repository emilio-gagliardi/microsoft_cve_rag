  "description": "After applying the updates related to CVE-2024-38102, users may experience a complete loss of network connectivity due to a denial of service condition stemming from the Windows Layer-2 Bridge Network Driver. This results in the inability to establish new connections or maintain existing ones within the affected network segment, which can severely impact system operations. The issue can persist as long as the network driver is unstable, causing a significant disruption in service availability. This is particularly relevant for systems running Windows Server 2022, Windows 11 Version 23H2 for x64-based Systems (Build 10.0.22631.3880), and earlier versions like Windows 10 Version 22H2 for 32-bit Systems (Build 10.0.19045.4651), as detailed in KB articles KB-5040427, KB-5040431, and KB-5040442. System administrators should closely monitor affected systems and assess impact following the update installation.",
