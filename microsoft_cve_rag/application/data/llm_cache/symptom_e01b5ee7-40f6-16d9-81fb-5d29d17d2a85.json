  "description": "Upon deployment of the April 9, 2024 update KB-5036899 for Windows Server products, users may experience remote code execution risks due to a vulnerability in the DNS server. End users might notice unexpected access issues or denial of service while querying DNS records, as the server becomes a target for remote code execution when specific conditions are met. This impact may lead to serious operational disruptions, including inability to resolve domain names or provide network resources. Affected products include Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2019, and Windows Server 2022, all affected by this important severity level vulnerability. Administrators are advised to closely monitor DNS activities post-update to prevent potential exploitation.",
