  "description": "The underlying cause of the installation failure referenced in this post relates to a misconfiguration when using BitLocker on older OEM systems. Specifically, if BitLocker is enabled, the associated partition may not have sufficient space to accommodate the WinRE update, leading to installation issues. This situation is particularly relevant for users on legacy OEM devices, as they often have restrictive configurations. The guidance provided in KB-5028997 instructs users on manually resizing their partition, which is critical to resolving the installation errors. Therefore, the mismanagement of disk partitions and their interaction with BitLocker encryption signifies a significant barrier to successfully applying the necessary updates.",
