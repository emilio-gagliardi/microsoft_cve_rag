  "description": "Users of Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) version 128.0.2739.42 may experience instability or crashes when rendering certain web pages, due to an out-of-bounds memory access vulnerability in the Skia graphics library. This occurs particularly with crafted HTML content that may lead to unexpected application behavior or visual artifacts. After applying the security update referenced in KB-128.0.2739.42, end users can expect enhanced stability and protection against potential exploits that could arise from such vulnerabilities. It is important for administrators to ensure that users\u2019 systems are updated promptly to mitigate these risks and avoid degraded performance or erratic behavior while browsing.",
