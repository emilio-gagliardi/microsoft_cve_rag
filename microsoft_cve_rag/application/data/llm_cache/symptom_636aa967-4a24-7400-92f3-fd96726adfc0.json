  "description": "A vulnerability chaining scenario has been identified in vulnerable Windows systems, particularly involving CVE-2024-21302 and CVE-2024-38202. An attacker with system access can exploit these vulnerabilities in tandem, thereby complicating their attack and potentially allowing for system file reversion or replacement. This may lead to system-wide regressions or the circumvention of virtualization-based security (VBS) features. The exploitation of this vulnerability chain poses significant risks, especially in high-stakes environments where system integrity is paramount. Microsoft is advising customers to review the provided mitigation guidance to protect against these risks effectively.",
