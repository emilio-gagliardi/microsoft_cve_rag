  "description": "After updating Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) to build 120.0.2210.133, users may experience noticeable slow performance issues during browsing sessions. This delay can manifest as web pages taking longer to load, increased lag when scrolling through content, and overall sluggish responsiveness when interacting with the browser interface. Users may also report intermittent freezing or stalling while utilizing web applications, which can hinder productivity and lead to frustration. These impacts are particularly noticeable in complex or resource-intensive websites. The update is associated with KB20709, which addresses various functionality issues stemming from system modifications.",
