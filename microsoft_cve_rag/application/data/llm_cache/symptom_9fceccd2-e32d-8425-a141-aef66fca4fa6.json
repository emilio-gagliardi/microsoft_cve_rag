Specifically, there may be intermittent connectivity issues, which lead to performance degradation and unresponsive network applications. This impact is particularly evident in environments relying heavily on the RNDISMP6.sys driver, affecting remote access and management tasks. Administrators should monitor network performance closely following these updates to ensure continued functionality.",
