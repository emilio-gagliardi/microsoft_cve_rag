  "description": "Enabling a temporary mitigation strategy in an audit policy may lead to potential conflicts when the permanent fix is deployed. System administrators must assess whether the temporary measures can coexist with forthcoming updates from Microsoft. There is a risk that the ongoing use of such mitigations could obscure audit events essential for future security assessments. Without careful management, this could result in operational issues or audits not functioning as intended. Administrators should monitor the system closely for any conflicts post-implementation to ensure compliance and functionality when the permanent fix is introduced.",
