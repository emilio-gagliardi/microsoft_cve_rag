  "description": "After the installation of the security updates identified by KB-5037788, KB-5037771, KB-5037770, and KB-5037768, Windows systems utilizing the Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS) experience interrupted service and potential unauthorized remote code execution. Users may observe system instability, such as application crashes or unexpected behavior when trying to establish remote connections. Furthermore, systems running build numbers including 10.0.19045.4412, 10.0.22631.3593, 10.0.22621.3593, and varying others may face issues that compromise data integrity and availability, potentially leading to unauthorized access to network resources. Administrators should remain vigilant for any service disruptions or anomalous communication behaviors post-update.",
