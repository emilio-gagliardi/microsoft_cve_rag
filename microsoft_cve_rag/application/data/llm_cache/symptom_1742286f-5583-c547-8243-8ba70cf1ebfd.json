  "description": "The issue manifests as the error message, 'The user profile service failed the sign in. User profile cannot be loaded,' impacting approximately 20% of PCs running Windows 10 22H2 and Windows 11 22H2. This problem appears after the installation of the October 2023 security update (KB5031356), leading to temporary folders, named with a .000 suffix, being created in the C:\\Users directory. Although users are able to log in after several reboots, the reliance on creating new profiles for continued access suggests a deeper systemic issue that may vary in permanence.",
