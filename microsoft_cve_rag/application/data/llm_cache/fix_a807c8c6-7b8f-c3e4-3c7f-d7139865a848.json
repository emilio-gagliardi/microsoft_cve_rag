  "description": "**Fix Overview**:\n\nTo mitigate the remote code execution vulnerability found in Linux shim boot, this update involves blocking old, unpatched Linux boot loaders by applying Secure Boot Advanced Targeting (SBAT) EFI variables in the UEFI library. This change enhances security during the boot process and prevents exploitation through crafted HTTP requests.\n\n1. Ensure that your system is updated to the Windows 11 version 24H2 or the applicable Windows Server version.\n2. Download and install the following updates to apply SBAT:\n   - KB5041571 for Windows 11 Version 24H2 (x64 and ARM64)\n   - KB5041585 for Windows 11 Version 23H2 (x64 and ARM64)\n   - KB5041580 for Windows 10 Version 22H2 (x64 and ARM64)\n   - KB5041592 for Windows 11 Version 21H2 (x64 and ARM64)\n3. Restart your machine after applying the updates to ensure full implementation.\n\n**Details**:\nThis update addresses critical feature bypass issues and functions to prevent exploitation by maintaining control over the boot process. Please ensure you follow the instructions carefully to maintain system integrity. Backup any critical data before proceeding with OS updates. \n\nFor more information and to access the update packages, visit:\n- [KB5041782](https://catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=KB5041782)  \n- [KB5041585](https://catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=KB5041585)  \n- [KB5041580](https://catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=KB5041580)  \n- [KB5041571](https://catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=KB5041571)  \n- [KB5041592](https://catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=KB5041592)  \n",
