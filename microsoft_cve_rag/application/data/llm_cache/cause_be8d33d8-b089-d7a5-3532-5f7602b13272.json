  "description": "The identified cause of CVE-2023-35642 is a vulnerability in Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) that allows for a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. This vulnerability arises due to the way the ICS component is bound within the network stack, where it is limited to adjacent protocols and networks. Attackers must be on the same network segment, either logically or physically, to exploit this condition, which requires no prior attacker privileges or user interaction. The afflicted software products include multiple build numbers across Windows Server 2008, 2012, and 2016, as well as various Windows 10 versions, such as 10.0.10240.20345, 10.0.19045.3803, and 10.0.22000.2652. The related KB Articles include KB-5033379, KB-5033375, KB-5033372, and KB-5033369, providing official documentation and remediation steps for affected systems.",
