  "description": "The underlying issue relates to the cessation of updates for Windows 10 version 21H2 as of June 2023, unless the device is part of an Enterprise or Education environment. This situation results in a significant challenge for users encountering difficulties with Windows Update (WU) due to the lack of ongoing support. Instead of diagnostic efforts to rectify the tough update problems, a more efficient workaround is to upgrade to the subsequent version of Windows, which inherently supersedes the problematic update files during installation. Thus, the root of the issue can be traced back to the end of updates for 21H2 for standard consumer systems, necessitating an upgrade to resolve WU-related complications effectively.",
