  "description": "Users experience crashes in Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) version 131.0.2903.48 when attempting to render certain HTML pages. This behavior is a direct result of the inappropriate implementation described in CVE-2024-11116. As users navigate to web pages that exploit this flaw, they will encounter unexpected terminations of the browser, resulting in lost sessions and disrupted workflows. It is essential for system administrators to ensure that users update their browsers to avoid encountering such crashes. Following the security update, the affected version should be updated to at least 131.0.6778.69 to mitigate these occurrences as indicated in the KB article.",
