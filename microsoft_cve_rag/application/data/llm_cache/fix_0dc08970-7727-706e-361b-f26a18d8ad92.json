  "description": "**Fix Overview**:\n\nTo resolve the 0x8007000d error encountered while adding an update source in Configuration Manager:\n\n1. Navigate to `C:\\Windows\\System32\\GroupPolicy\\Machine`.\n2. Rename the `Registry.pol` file to something like `Registry.pol.old` to preserve the existing file.\n3. Re-run the software updates scan cycle from the ConfigMgr actions tab.\n\n**Details**:\n- Renaming the `Registry.pol` file can help reset the Group Policy settings associated with the machine, which may be causing the error during the update source addition. This method allows Configuration Manager to recreate a new, default `Registry.pol` file upon the next update cycle, potentially resolving the issue. \n- Ensure to monitor the results after running the scan cycle to verify that the issue has been resolved.",
