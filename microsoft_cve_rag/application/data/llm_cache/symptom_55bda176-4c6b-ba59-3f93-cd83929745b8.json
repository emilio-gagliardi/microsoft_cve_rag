  "description": "After upgrading to Microsoft Edge version 129.0.2792.89, users may experience system instability characterized by frequent crashes or hangs. This may be attributed to a type confusion vulnerability in the underlying Chromium engine, which can lead to unexpected behaviors such as application errors, freezes, or failure to load pages properly. Reports indicate that sessions might terminate abruptly, disrupting user tasks and workflow. To mitigate these issues, users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest version of Edge to avoid the effects of this vulnerability, indicated by the release of newer build 129.0.6668.100, as documented in KB-129.0.2792.89. The aggressive nature of the crashes could hinder productivity, resulting in potential data loss if unsaved work is affected.",
