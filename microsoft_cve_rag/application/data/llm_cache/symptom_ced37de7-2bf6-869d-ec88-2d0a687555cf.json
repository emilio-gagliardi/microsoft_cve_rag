  "description": "End users experience persistent problems with feature releases that no longer reset system components and are instead merely enablement packages. As a result, standard repair methods, such as sfc (System File Checker) and DISM (Deployment Image Servicing and Management), have proven ineffective for resolving these ongoing issues. The only viable solution to restore functionality appears to be performing a repair install of the operating system. This symptom has been reported extensively over many years, indicating a significant and unresolved challenge within the Windows ecosystem. Guidance on this issue can be found in the corresponding KB Article 5041580.",
