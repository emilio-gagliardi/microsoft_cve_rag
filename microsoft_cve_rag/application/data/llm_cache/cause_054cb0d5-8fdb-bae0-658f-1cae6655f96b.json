  "description": "The underlying cause of the issues described is the lack of Extended Security Updates (ESUs) for Windows Server 2008, which may lead to vulnerabilities if the systems are not adequately patched or upgraded. Many clients are facing challenges in trying to ensure that their systems are secure while remaining within the parameters set by Azure billing for these updates. The absence of ESUs hampers organizations' abilities to maintain compliance and security posture, especially considering the critical nature of their operations on this outdated platform. Organizations need to be proactive in understanding the upgrade paths and necessary provisions to leverage these updates effectively, especially given recent revisions around Azure billing. The issues stem from systemic misconfigurations that arise during the billing cycle while trying to secure necessary access to these updates, which are crucial for protecting their infrastructure.",
