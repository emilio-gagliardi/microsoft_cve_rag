  "description": "The underlying cause of the vulnerabilities in Ivanti products stems from improper input validation and authentication failures within various components of the software. Specifically, Ivanti Avalanche 6.3.1 is susceptible to remote code execution due to validation issues in its central filestore (CVE-2024-37373). Additionally, Ivanti Virtual Traffic Manager versions other than 22.2r1 or 22.7r2 have an incorrect implementation of an authentication algorithm that allows unauthorized access (CVE-2024-7593). Other vulnerabilities, including improper certificate validations and null pointer dereferences, can further allow attackers to exploit these weaknesses, resulting in unauthorized system access and denial of service attacks. These issues emphasize the critical importance of timely patching and robust input validation mechanisms across all affected Ivanti products.",
