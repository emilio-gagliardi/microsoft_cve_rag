  "description": "A Windows upgrade from WSUS is failing due to insufficient available disk space on the VM, specifically lacking the required 250 MB of free space. The current disk free space is reported as only 105.6 MB, which is below the necessary threshold. This can prevent the upgrade from proceeding, as setupdiag.exe reveals it cannot continue without adequate free space. Administrators should ensure that all test machines meet disk space requirements before rolling out upgrades in a production environment. The issue is particularly relevant for virtual machines running VMware Tools version 12.3.5.",
