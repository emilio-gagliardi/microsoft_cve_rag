  "description": "After installing security updates labeled as KB5046613, KB5046617, and KB5046696, users may experience unexpected limitations in their ability to access certain features or perform administrative tasks within the Windows Telephony Service. This could manifest as a restriction in executing certain commands or changes being denied due to elevated privileges not being granted. Additionally, the impacted Windows versions (such as 10 and 11 across various build numbers) can lead to user frustration as tasks that previously required standard privileges now trigger permission errors. This can particularly affect system administrators attempting to manage or configure telephony settings on these systems. Users may be alerted with error messages indicating insufficient permissions when attempting actions they used to perform effortlessly prior to applying the updates.",
