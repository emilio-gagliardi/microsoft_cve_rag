  "description": "After updating to Chrome version 131.0.6778.69, users on Linux Mint 21.3 experience an interruption in their workflow as the browser prompts them to enter a password to unlock their login keyring. This behavior indicates a potential issue with keyring management in association with the official build of Chrome. Users may find this particularly frustrating, especially if they were previously able to access their login credentials seamlessly. As this situation occurs upon launch, it could impede user productivity and may require additional steps to reconfigure password management settings. Troubleshooting may be necessary to ensure that the login keyring behaves as expected moving forward.",
