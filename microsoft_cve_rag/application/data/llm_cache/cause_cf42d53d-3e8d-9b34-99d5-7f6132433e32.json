  "description": "The underlying cause of CVE-2024-20666 stems from a flaw in the BitLocker security feature, which is supposed to protect device encryption. This vulnerability allows an attacker with physical access to bypass BitLocker, enabling access to encrypted data on the storage device. The issue lies in the misconfiguration of the Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE) that may not be updated correctly across different Windows versions. If the recovery environment does not have the latest security patches applied, it creates an opportunity for attackers to exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the recovery partition. Furthermore, the scenario emphasizes that exploitation requires knowledge of the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) pin if it is configured with BitLocker protection, demonstrating that specific configurations must be in place to facilitate the bypass.",
