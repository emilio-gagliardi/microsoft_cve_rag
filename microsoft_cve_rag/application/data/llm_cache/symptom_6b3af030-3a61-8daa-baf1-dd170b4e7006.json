  "description": "The enterprise download page indicates that the version 122.0.2365.63 is only available for Linux and macOS, while the version for Windows is now absent. This change could significantly affect organizations that rely on the Windows version for compatibility and support. The removal of the Windows version may lead to disruptions in user applications that were running this specific build. System administrators may need to scramble for immediate alternatives or workarounds to maintain their operational capabilities. The issue was noted on March 1, 2024, suggesting a rapid shift in availability.",
