  "description": "To address the error 'The User Profile Service failed the sign in. User profile cannot be loaded', it is suggested to create a new user profile. This action appears to resolve the immediate login issue for affected systems running Windows 10 22H2 and Windows 11 22H2. Despite previous troubleshooting steps involving checking registry entries and running repair commands (SFC and DISM), these did not rectify the problem. It's worth noting that uninstalling the October 2023 security KB5031356 has not alleviated the issue either. Users should monitor the stability of the newly created profile to ensure that it resolves the issue over time and consider antivirus exclusions if necessary.",
