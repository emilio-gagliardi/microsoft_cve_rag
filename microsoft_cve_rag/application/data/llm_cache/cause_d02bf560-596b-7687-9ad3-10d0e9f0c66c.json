  "description": "The underlying cause of CVE-2024-43582 is a use after free condition in the Remote Desktop Protocol server, which allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code remotely. This vulnerability arises when memory is improperly managed, leading to the potential execution of malicious code if an attacker sends malformed packets to the RPC host. It affects components bound to the network stack, making it exploitable from remote locations without user interaction, triggering a race condition that the attacker can exploit.",
