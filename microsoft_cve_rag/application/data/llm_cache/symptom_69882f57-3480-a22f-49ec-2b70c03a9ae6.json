  "description": "The Microsoft QUIC implementation experiences a critical denial of service event after installation of certain updates, affecting multiple build versions, including Windows 11 (versions 21H2, 22H2, and 23H2). Users may observe that network connectivity becomes completely unavailable, preventing access to applications and services that rely on the affected protocols. This lack of availability is persistent and can significantly disrupt operational activities, as the underlying resource consumption leads to a complete lockdown of the affected services. Such behavior is closely tied to the issues that arise from the updates identified in KB5035853 and KB5035854, which target various versions of Windows and Visual Studio. System administrators should be particularly vigilant to ensure that their environments are patched with the necessary updates to mitigate these impacts effectively.",
