  "description": "The underlying cause of the issue derives from the assumption that the primary disk is always disk 0. In approximately 15% of managed devices with configurations such as PCIe + SSD or SSD + HDD, the OS disk is not the primary disk, leading to misconfigurations. For example, some file servers may have the OS disk labeled as disk 4 instead of the expected disk 0. This incorrect disk configuration hampers recovery operations using Windows RE (WinRE) as it may be located on a different disk. Furthermore, clients utilizing dangerous multiple disk setups complicate OS recovery, especially when modifying disk configurations that do not align with WinRE's expectations helping further contribute to operational instability.",
