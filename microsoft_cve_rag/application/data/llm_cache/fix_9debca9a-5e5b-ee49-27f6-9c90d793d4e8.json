  "description": "**Fix Overview**:\n\nTo resolve issues with Microsoft Connected Cache after the February 2024 Windows security update:\n\n1. Configure the Microsoft Connected Cache endpoint in the `docachehost` policy as specified in the cache hostname. \n\n2. Set `docachehostsource` to `1` or remove its value as indicated in the cache hostname source.\n   - Note: By default, both `docachehost` and `docachehostsource` policies have no value.\n\n**Details**:\n- This configuration ensures that devices utilize Microsoft Connected Cache nodes effectively, avoiding unnecessary downloads from the public internet.\n- Alternatively, this issue may also be mitigated using group policies available through support channels. Organizations can request assistance via support for business.\n- Stay tuned for updates as we are actively working on a resolution for this issue. (LLM Synthesized)",
