  "description": "After the installation of security updates related to the Windows USB Generic Parent Driver, users may observe unexpected behaviors such as system instability or crashes. Specifically, systems built on Windows 10 (builds 19045.4046, 19044.4046, etc.) and Windows 11 (builds 22631.3155, 22000.2777) are vulnerable to remote code execution. Users may face difficulty in performing typical operations, leading to a significant degradation in system performance. The presence of security update KB-5034763 is critical, as it addresses the underlying issue linked to this vulnerability. Moreover, administrators should be particularly vigilant of potential integrity and availability issues that may arise post-update, affecting the operational reliability of their systems.",
