  "description": "The underlying cause inferred from the post is the mandated adoption of Delivery Optimization (DO) for Microsoft Teams updates. This requirement is driven by Microsoft's Servicing Agreement, which specifies that updates must be automatically installed. As part of this process, Delivery Optimization facilitates the distribution of updates across the network, but reliance on DO must be carefully managed. The warning about download mode 100 (bypass) not being supported explicitly indicates that failing to comply with this configuration could result in incomplete or problematic updates. Consequently, sysadmins must ensure that their configurations align with Microsoft's guidelines to avoid potential update failures.",
