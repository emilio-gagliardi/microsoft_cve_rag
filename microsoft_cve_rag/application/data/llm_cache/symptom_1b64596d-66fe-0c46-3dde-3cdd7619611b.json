  "description": "When attempting to remove Copilot from a Windows 11 environment, users may experience issues that result in the 'News' page becoming completely non-functional. This symptom was observed on a test computer with non-admin rights after Copilot was disabled. The removal process does not ensure the proper functionality of other integrated features, indicating potential bugs or architectural flaws in the handling of Copilot's dependencies within the operating system. Further testing is needed to understand the full scope of the impact on different machines. Interested testers are encouraged to verify this behavior to determine if it is a widespread issue across multiple installations.",
