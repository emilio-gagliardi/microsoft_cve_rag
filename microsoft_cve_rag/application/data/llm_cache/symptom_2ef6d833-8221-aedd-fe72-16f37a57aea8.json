  "description": "During the installation of cumulative updates for Exchange Server, an issue can arise where the setup process indicates that the installation has completed successfully, despite actually failing. This problem particularly affects modern hybrid installations when updates are run in unattended mode via PowerShell or command prompt. If the command does not specify the full path to setup.exe or is not prefixed with '.\\' while executed from the installation directory, the installation may not function correctly. This misleading success report can lead to significant confusion and operational issues as system administrators might assume the update was applied properly. To mitigate the CVE-2024-21410 risk, enabling extended protection is crucial, highlighting the need for precise execution of setup commands. Refer to KB4047506 and KB21410 for further guidance.",
