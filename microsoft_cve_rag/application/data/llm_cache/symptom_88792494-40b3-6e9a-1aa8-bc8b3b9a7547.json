  "description": "The Microsoft Local Security Authority (LSA) can disclose sensitive information, potentially allowing an attacker to read portions of stack memory. This behavior may lead to unauthorized access to confidential data on affected systems, particularly in environments running Windows 11 Version 24H2 (KB5041571) and several versions of Windows Server. Users may not notice any immediate symptoms, but administrators should remain vigilant for abnormal data access patterns or unauthorized resource readings that could indicate exploitation. The issue affects multiple builds and necessitates prompt update application to mitigate risk.",
