  "description": "After the installation of updates identified in KB5044285, KB5044284, KB5044280, and KB5044273 on Windows 10 (builds 19045, 19044, 22621, and others), system administrators may observe that unauthorized local users can acquire elevated privileges unexpectedly through winlogon. This behavior effectively allows standard users access to perform administrative functions, which can severely compromise the integrity of the system. As a result, security configurations may be bypassed, leading to potential unauthorized access or changes to critical system settings or files. This symptom denotes a critical shift in expected user permissions and raises an urgent need for attention to ensure proper device configurations post-update. Continuous monitoring of device roles, user permissions, and active sessions is crucial to safeguard against these unauthorized elevations.",
