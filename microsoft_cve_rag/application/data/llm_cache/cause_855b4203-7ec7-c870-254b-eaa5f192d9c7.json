  "description": "The underlying issue is attributed to a missing dependency on crucial Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) associated with DISM (Deployment Image Servicing and Management) provided by Microsoft. Specifically, the 'metadeployprovider.dll' and 'siloedpackageprovider.dll' files are necessary for DISM to function correctly during system upgrades to Windows 11. The absence of these DLLs can lead to failures in processing upgrades, thus impeding system performance and stability. The potential solution mentioned involves installing the latest Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (ADK), which may restore the missing components, although there is no guarantee of replication across different systems. This issue reflects a deeper dependency management challenge within the Windows ecosystem, especially during significant updates.",
