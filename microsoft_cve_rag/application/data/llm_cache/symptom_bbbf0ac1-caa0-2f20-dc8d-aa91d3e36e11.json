  "description": "The installation of KB5037765 is failing on Server 2019 systems, as evidenced by the servers not reporting the need for the patch in Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager (MECM). This behavior leads to an incorrect assessment of the patch status, causing administrators to manually verify and install the update despite MECM indicating no actions are required. Furthermore, the Defender portal indicates that the patch is indeed needed on all affected servers, exacerbating the confusion. As a result, systems are left unpatched due to MECM's failure to accurately reflect patch applicability, which can lead to potential vulnerabilities if the patches address critical issues. This situation necessitates manual intervention, contradicting automation efforts in patch management.",
