  "description": "Users of Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) version 130.0.2849.56 may experience application crashes when attempting to load specific web pages or interact with certain online content. This issue stems from a type confusion vulnerability within the Chromium engine that could lead to unstable browser behavior or abrupt shutdowns. End users might notice that the browser unexpectedly closes or fails to respond, resulting in loss of data and productivity. To mitigate this, it is critical for users to upgrade to the patched version referenced in KB-130.0.2849.56, which addresses this issue and enhances overall stability. Regular updates should be monitored to maintain security and functionality as Microsoft Edge evolves.",
