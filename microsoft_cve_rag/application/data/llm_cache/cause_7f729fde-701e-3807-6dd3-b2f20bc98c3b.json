  "description": "The vulnerability arises from improper resolution of path equivalence in Windows security zone mapping, allowing an attacker to construct a URL that is interpreted as belonging to a more privileged zone, thereby bypassing security features. This can exploit local access through read/write/execute capabilities or require user interaction to trigger actions that exploit the vulnerability.",
