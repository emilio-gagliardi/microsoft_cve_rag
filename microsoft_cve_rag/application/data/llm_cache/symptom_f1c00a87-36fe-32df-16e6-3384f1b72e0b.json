  "description": "End users may experience security concerns as sensitive information is unintentionally disclosed when using Windows Resilient File System (ReFS) on affected systems. This disclosure can consist of initialized or uninitialized memory data from the process heap, potentially exposing confidential user information or sensitive application data. As a result, system administrators may need to increase vigilance regarding information confidentiality and data protection policies, particularly on systems running Windows 11 versions 22H2, 23H2, and 24H2, as documented in KB articles KB5044284 and KB5044285. Missing the essential updates that mitigate this vulnerability might lead to a growing risk of exploitation, demanding immediate attention from IT security teams.",
