  "description": "The underlying cause of the issue described in CVE-2024-20687 is a denial of service vulnerability in the Microsoft AllJoyn API. This issue arises from the component being bound directly to the network stack, which allows for exploitation across multiple network hops, potentially over the internet. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability without requiring any initial access privileges or user interaction, making it a remotely exploitable condition. The vulnerability\u2019s configuration does not demand any specialized access conditions, leading to a severe impact on the availability of the services relying on this API. The affected products include various Windows versions, particularly in specific build numbers such as 10.0.10240.20402, 10.0.19045.3930, and others as documented in the relevant KB articles (KB-5034134, KB-5034123, etc.).",
