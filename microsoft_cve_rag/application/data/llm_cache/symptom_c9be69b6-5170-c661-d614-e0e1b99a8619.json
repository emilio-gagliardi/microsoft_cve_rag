  "description": "Users of Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) version 128.0.2739.42 may experience crashes when the browser attempts to process a malicious file. This behavior can occur when an attacker convinces a legitimate user to open a specially crafted file, which exploits a remote code execution vulnerability identified as CVE-2024-38210. This issue is significant because it leads to a complete loss of functionality of the Edge browser during the processing of the harmful content. As a result, users may find themselves unable to continue their work, leading to interruptions in productivity. The associated KB article for this issue is KB38210, highlighting the importance of applying the necessary security updates to restore browser stability.",
