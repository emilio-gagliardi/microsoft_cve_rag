  "description": "Users of Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) version 129.0.2792.79 may experience crashes or freezes following the installation of security updates that address an integer overflow vulnerability identified as CVE-2024-7025. This issue can manifest as the browser becoming unresponsive during page rendering, especially on complex web pages that utilize extensive layout features. The observable behavior includes unexpected application closures, loss of session data, and disruptions in user workflow due to the abrupt nature of these crashes. End users may notice that they need to restart the browser multiple times before successful navigation can resume. The problem affects users who have not yet updated to the subsequent build version 129.0.6668.90, which resolves the underlying concern.",
