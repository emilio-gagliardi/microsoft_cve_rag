  "description": "Delivery Optimization (DO) is a Windows feature that allows for automatic updates of Microsoft Teams to be managed more efficiently. It enables the downloading of updates from multiple sources simultaneously, which can improve update speed and reduce bandwidth consumption. This feature is especially useful for organizations with multiple systems needing updates, as it minimizes the load on individual network connections. To configure Delivery Optimization, administrators need to set the appropriate settings in Windows Update and ensure that the download mode is not set to 'bypass' as it is unsupported. It streamlines the update process, enabling compliance with servicing agreements while leveraging peer-to-peer technology for optimized delivery. **The detailed explanation for this Tool is provided in the Fix description.**",
