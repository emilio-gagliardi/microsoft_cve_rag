  "description": "The Microsoft ODBC driver exhibits a fundamental flaw due to incorrect conversion between numeric types, allowing remote attackers to exploit this via specially crafted replies to execute arbitrary code in the victim's SQL client application. This issue is facilitated when an authenticated user connects to a malicious SQL database, with their client application being manipulated to execute arbitrary code within that context.",
