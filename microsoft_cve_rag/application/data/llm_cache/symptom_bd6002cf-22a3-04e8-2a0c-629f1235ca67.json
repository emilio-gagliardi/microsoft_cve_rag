  "description": "Users may encounter warnings when attempting to access links that have been flagged as potentially malicious due to the spoofing vulnerability (CVE-2024-38156) affecting Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) versions 126.0.2592.102 and 116.0.1938.81. This may manifest as alerts in the browser when a user interacts with specially crafted URLs that could potentially lead to compromised interactions. These warnings suggest that the browser has detected an unsafe link, thus preventing the user from being redirected to a harmful website. Although this feature aims to enhance user protection, it may disrupt normal browsing activities as users need to navigate around these alerts. Additionally, administrators might notice an increase in support requests from users confused about these warnings, affecting user experience significantly. The associated KB article for these updates is KB38156.",
