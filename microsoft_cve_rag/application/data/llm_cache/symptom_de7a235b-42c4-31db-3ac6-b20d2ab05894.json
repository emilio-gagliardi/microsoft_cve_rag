  "description": "A recent issue has emerged where the child domain controller (DC) is no longer permitting the targeting of new Group Policy Objects (GPOs) by specific user groups. This situation appears to stem from the fact that only the root DC has received the necessary patches, while the child DC remains unpatched. As a consequence, administrators may find it increasingly challenging to apply the desired policies effectively across the domain. Such limitations could lead to inconsistencies in policy application and an overall degraded management experience of the Active Directory environment. For further details, refer to KB-041578, which addresses related issues and potential resolutions.",
