  "description": "End users may experience unexpected system behavior after the installation of security updates. This may include unauthorized access to critical system functions, allowing attackers to gain elevated privileges, which could lead to the modification of sensitive files or settings. Users of Windows 10 (versions 21H2 and 22H2, builds 10.0.19044.5131 and 10.0.19045.5131) and Windows 11 (version 24H2, build 10.0.26100.2314) are particularly impacted. As a result of this vulnerability (CVE-2024-43646), users might find their system is not behaving as expected, or they might find that certain administrative tasks can be performed without appropriate credentials. The relevant KB Articles include KB5046612 for multiple Windows versions, specifically tailored to mitigate this elevation of privilege concern.",
