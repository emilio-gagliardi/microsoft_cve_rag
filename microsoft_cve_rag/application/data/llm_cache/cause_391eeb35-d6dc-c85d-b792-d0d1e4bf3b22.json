  "description": "The underlying issue pertains to the headphone functionality after upgrading from Windows 10 to Windows 11. The laptop shipped with Windows 10 and was upgraded by the customer, during which the Realtek Waves MAXX Audio software app became missing. This app is critical for audio management, yet the installer for Windows 11 directs users to the Microsoft Store as the download differs from the Windows 10 version. Moreover, the auto-sensing audio jack may have a repairable bad solder connection that isn't inspectable due to remote access limitations. The sound continues to output through the speakers regardless of headphone connection, indicating a potential hardware interaction failure post-upgrade.",
