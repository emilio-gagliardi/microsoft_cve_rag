  "description": "The underlying cause of CVE-2024-30006 is a use-after-free condition in the Microsoft WDAC OLE DB provider for SQL Server, which allows an attacker to exploit network vulnerabilities by crafting malicious SQL packets. This condition occurs when memory that has already been freed is accessed again, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution within the context of an authenticated user's SQL client application. The vulnerability can be exploited when a user is tricked into connecting to a malicious SQL Server using OLE DB or ODBC drivers, allowing the attacker to deliver malicious responses that exploit the use-after-free flaw.",
