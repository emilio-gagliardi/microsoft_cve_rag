  "description": "After installing security updates associated with KB-5041592, KB-5041585, KB-5041580, and KB-5041571 on systems running affected builds of Grub2, users may experience significant unavailability issues. Specifically, the system may fail to boot correctly or become unresponsive, which is a direct consequence of the heap-based out-of-bounds write issue identified in CVE-2022-3775. This impact presents in various Windows 10 and Windows 11 versions, including build numbers 10.0.19044.4780, 10.0.19045.4780, and 10.0.26100.1457. System administrators should monitor for these behaviors post-update to ensure operational integrity and minimize service outages.",
