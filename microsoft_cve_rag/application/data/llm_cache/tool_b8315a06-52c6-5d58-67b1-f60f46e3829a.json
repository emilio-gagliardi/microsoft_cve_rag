  "description": "**Tool Overview**:\n\nThe new Snipping Tool feature added in Windows KB-5039211 enhances the screenshot capabilities for Windows 10 22H2 users.\n\n**Details**:\n\nThis feature enables users to take different types of screenshots easily, including full-screen, rectangular, free-form, and window snips. Once a screenshot is taken, it can be annotated, saved, or shared directly from the tool. This is particularly useful for system administrators and support professionals who need to provide visual documentation for troubleshooting and user support. The Snipping Tool has been integrated into the OS, making it readily available for users without needing additional downloads or installations.\n\nThis update also includes fixes related to taskbar glitches observed in the Preview update for Windows 11 23H2, ensuring a smoother user experience when using the taskbar alongside the new snipping abilities.\n",
