  "symptom_label": "jre_auto_update_blocked_by_user_agent_filter",
  "description": "The Java Runtime Environment's (JRE) automatic update process is blocked due to a user-agent filter, preventing successful download of updates. This issue arises primarily when utilizing certain URLs which apply restrictive filters based on the user agent string. Administrators can experience difficulties while trying to implement updates seamlessly, disrupting regular maintenance schedules for the environment. To workaround this limitation, it is suggested to adjust the user-agent string to simulate popular browsers, which requires continuous updates to the string based on the latest versions. This approach, while effective, can complicate the automation of JRE updates, making it essential for system administrators to devise robust scripting solutions or utilize tools like Ketarin for improved management.",
