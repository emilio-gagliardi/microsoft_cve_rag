  "description": "The root cause of the issue stems from the need to update the Active Directory Administrative Template (ADMX) files that govern the Microsoft Edge settings. When the ADMX templates are not current, the local and group policies that manage Edge settings may not function as intended, leading to potential misconfigurations. This can result in users experiencing unexpected behaviors or a lack of control over their Edge browser settings. Keeping the ADMX templates updated is crucial to ensure that all policies are accurately reflected and applied according to the latest build updates and security practices. It is essential for system administrators to regularly consult the current policy documentation to avoid these issues.",
