  "description": "When upgrading from Windows 10 to Windows 11 with Credential Guard enabled, users may experience instant reboots caused by the missing critical registry key. Specifically, the upgrade process wipes out essential registry settings, leading to lsass.exe crashes when cached credentials are attempted. This issue indicates a failure to properly manage and retain important security configurations during the upgrade process. To resolve the problem, administrators can export specific registry settings from a clean installation of Windows 11 without Credential Guard and import them back into the affected system. The required registry path includes important values that are crucial for lsass.exe's functioning, ensuring that the system can handle isolated credentials properly again.",
