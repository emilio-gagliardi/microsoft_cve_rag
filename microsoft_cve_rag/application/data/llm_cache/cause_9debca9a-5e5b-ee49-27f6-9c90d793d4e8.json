  "description": "After the installation of the February 2024 Windows security update (KB-5034763), enterprise customers using Microsoft Connected Cache may experience issues where their devices download updates from the public internet instead of utilizing the configured cache nodes. This occurs primarily for Windows 10 devices operating version 21H2 and utilizing DHCP option 235 for discovering connected cache nodes. The underlying cause appears to be a change in the update process that disrupts the normal functionality of the connected cache in enterprise environments, leading to increased internet traffic. Although home users are less likely to be affected due to lower utilization of connected caching, the changes impact enterprises significantly. To mitigate the issue, IT administrators can adjust the docachehost policy parameters as well as leverage available group policies through support channels for a proper resolution.",
