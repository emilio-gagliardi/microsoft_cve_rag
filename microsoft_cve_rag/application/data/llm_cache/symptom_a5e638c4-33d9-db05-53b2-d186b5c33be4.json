  "description": "Users may experience an issue where plugging in known good wired headphones into the headphone jack does not trigger any audio output change, leaving sound playing through the built-in speakers. In this case, a Dell Latitude 3500 running Windows 11 Pro (build 22H2) is unable to recognize and notify when headphones are connected. The Realtek audio driver is reported to be the latest version, and the user has attempted to refresh and reinstall it without any improvement. Additionally, sound settings across different configurations in the control panel and device manager show no errors or relevant issues. This problem is commonly reported, suggesting it may be related to driver compatibility or settings not being properly configured.",
