  "description": "After applying the security updates detailed in this post, users may experience unauthorized access to system privileges due to improper access control configurations. This issue, which affects multiple Windows versions including Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2016, and Windows 11 (various builds), could allow an attacker with physical access to gain elevated privileges. System administrators must be cautious as this could lead to serious compromise of the system's security. Notably, the impacted builds include Windows 10 Version 22H2 for x64-based systems (10.0.19045.4780) with KB5041580, and Windows 11 Version 24H2 for x64-based systems (10.0.26100.1457) with KB5041571, among others. Monitoring for unexpected system behavior or privilege escalations is crucial post-update.",
