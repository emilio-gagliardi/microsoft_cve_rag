  "description": "Upon exploitation, users may experience unexpected changes in system privileges, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive resources. Affected Windows systems, including builds 10.0.19045.5011, 10.0.26100.2033, and others, exhibit behaviors where applications might operate with elevated privileges without the user's consent. This could manifest as unauthorized actions performed within user accounts, presenting serious security ramifications. The vulnerability is outlined in multiple KB articles, including KB5044285 and KB5044280, emphasizing its critical nature regarding privilege escalation. System administrators should be prepared to address access issues and monitor for unusual activity following the installation of related security patches.",
