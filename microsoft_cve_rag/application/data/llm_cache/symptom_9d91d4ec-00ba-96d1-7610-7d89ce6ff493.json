  "description": "The observed behavior resulting from CVE-2023-50868 affects DNSSEC validation, leading to instances where legitimate user requests are met with significant delays or complete inaccessibility. Users may experience denial of service conditions as the system becomes overwhelmed due to excessive CPU utilization while processing DNSSEC responses. This high CPU consumption is particularly noticeable during operations involving multiple requests from affected systems, and it can render the DNS resolver unresponsive for extended periods. Systems involved, such as Windows Server 2022, 2016, and 2019, may show degraded service levels, affecting network performance and client connectivity. Relevant KB article for this issue is KB-5039330.",
