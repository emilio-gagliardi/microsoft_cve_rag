  "description": "Users are experiencing an issue in Office 2016 on Windows 11 (version 23H2) where the 'Save As' dialog defaults to OneDrive instead of allowing the option to save directly to the Desktop. This behavior has been noted after applying certain security updates (KB5002591 and KB5002575) on multiple devices. While one device still retains the ability to save to desktop, the inconsistency across machines adds to user frustration. This change in default options impacts user workflows, especially for those accustomed to saving files locally rather than cloud storage. Although saving to the Desktop is discouraged, the altered functionality represents a significant shift in how users interact with Office applications on Windows 11.",
