  "description": "Users may experience unauthorized code execution on their systems when connecting to a malicious SQL server through the OLE DB Provider for SQL Server. This occurs under specific circumstances where the authenticated user is tricked into establishing a connection with a compromised SQL database. Once this connection is made, the malicious server can send specially crafted replies that exploit the vulnerability, leading to the execution of arbitrary code within the user's SQL client application. Affected products include Windows Server 2008 and later, Windows 10, and Windows 11, particularly builds 10.0.19045.4170, 10.0.22000.2836, and others as noted in KB articles KB-5035858, KB-5035854, and KB-5035853. System administrators need to be vigilant as this remote execution can significantly compromise both security and data integrity.",
