  "description": "An authenticated attacker may exploit the sudo for Windows vulnerability by crafting a malicious application that requires user interaction to be executed. Users might notice unexpected prompts or behavior when performing commands in a console window, as they may be misled into executing these malicious requests. This behavior can lead to user confusion and unintentional actions, disrupting normal operation. The systems affected include Windows 11 Version 24H2 for x64-based and ARM64-based systems with build number 10.0.26100.2033, as documented in KB article KB5044284. The crucial aspect is that this symptom reflects the indirect impact on users due to potential spoofing incidents stemming from the vulnerability.",
