  "description": "Users experience unexpected crashes of Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) version 128.0.2739.79 when attempting to utilize the autofill feature, particularly during form submissions. This can lead to data loss as users may lose any unsaved information inputted in forms. The issue is a direct consequence of a vulnerability identified as CVE-2024-8639, which has been noted for its potential to cause heap corruption. While the browser is being updated to mitigate the issue, users may notice slower response times or crashes until the latest version is confirmed installed. It's essential for users to verify they are on the stable version following the security update to avoid these visual disruptions in their browsing experience.",
