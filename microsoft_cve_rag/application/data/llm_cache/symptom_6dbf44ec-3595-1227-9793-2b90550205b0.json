  "description": "End users may experience unexpected application behavior or application crashes when using systems affected by the Windows Link Layer Topology Discovery Protocol. Specifically, if users attempt to run network mapping functionality over Wi-Fi, they could trigger a remote code execution vulnerability. This manifests as systems becoming unresponsive or displaying erratic functions, particularly for systems running Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 and Windows Server 2008 SP2, as detailed in KB-5039266 and KB-5039245. Administrators should be aware that these impacts can disrupt regular network operations and compromise system stability, thereby contributing to longer downtimes and diminished productivity. Users are advised to apply security updates as outlined in Microsoft\u2019s guidance to mitigate this risk.",
