  "symptom_label": "KerberosProtocolSettingsNotEnforcedOnXP",
  "description": "The observed issue indicates that the full enforcement of the Kerberos protocol settings is not taking place on certain Domain Controllers, specifically relating to the absence of registry key changes. The expectation for a value of 3 (full enforcement) has not been met, which may impact the security and functionality of legacy Windows XP systems within the network. This suggests potential misconfigurations or inconsistencies in the application of security policies, which could leave these systems vulnerable to known threats.",
