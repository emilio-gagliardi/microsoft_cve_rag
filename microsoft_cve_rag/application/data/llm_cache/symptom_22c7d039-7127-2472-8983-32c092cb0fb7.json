  "description": "After applying the security updates associated with KB-5034123, KB-5034122, and KB-5034121, systems running affected versions of Windows may experience unexpected behaviors. Users report incidents of remote code execution, effectively allowing unauthorized execution of commands or malicious code within their environments. Systems operating on Windows Server 2022, Windows 11 versions 23H2, 22H2, and 21H2 (both x64 and ARM64 architectures), along with Windows 10 versions 22H2 and 21H2, are particularly vulnerable. These issues may lead to a complete loss of integrity and availability, prompting urgent needs for administrative intervention to mitigate risks. End-users may notice unusual system lag, application crashes, or an overall reduced responsiveness following the installation of the updates intended to address the identified vulnerabilities.",
