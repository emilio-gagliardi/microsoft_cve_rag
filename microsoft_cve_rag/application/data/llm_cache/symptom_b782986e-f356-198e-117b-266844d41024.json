  "description": "After applying updates associated with KB5040442, KB5040431, and KB5040427, systems running builds 10.0.22631.3880, 10.0.22621.3880, 10.0.19045.4651, 10.0.19044.4651, or 10.0.22000.3079 may experience issues where the Secure Boot feature does not function as intended. This can lead to unexpected behaviors such as unauthorized software running during system startup, which compromises the integrity of the boot process. Administrators might observe that certain security policies are not enforced as expected, potentially allowing insecure configurations or unverified drivers to load. This situation can create a window of vulnerability, prompting immediate attention to ensure that systems are properly secured and that the integrity of the environment is maintained. Users may notice warnings related to secure boot during system checks, indicating that the feature is bypassed or not fully operational, necessitating further investigation.",
