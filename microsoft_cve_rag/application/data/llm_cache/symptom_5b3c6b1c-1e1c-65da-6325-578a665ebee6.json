  "symptom_label": "third_party_tool_not_showing_new_patches",
  "description": "The observed behavior involves a third-party patching tool failing to display newly released out-of-band Windows Server patches (KB5037425 and others) due to the lingering presence of outdated patches (KB5035849 and others) in its catalog. As a result, system administrators may not be aware of critical cumulative security updates that address significant security issues. This inability to reflect new patches complicates the patch management process, potentially leaving systems vulnerable if administrators rely solely on the third-party tool for updates. The situation is particularly concerning as these new patches are vital for maintaining system security and are not classified correctly in the Microsoft update catalog, which adds an additional layer of confusion for users. Consequently, there is a risk that systems remain un-patched, exposing them to known security flaws.",
