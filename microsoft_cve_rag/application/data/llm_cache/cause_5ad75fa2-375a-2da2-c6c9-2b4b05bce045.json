  "description": "The root cause of CVE-2023-36423 is an out-of-bounds write vulnerability within the Microsoft Remote Registry Service. This flaw allows a remote, authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target server by exploiting the mismanagement of memory allocation during write operations. Specifically, it is related to how data is handled when interfacing with the network stack, making it susceptible to network-based attacks without the need for user interaction. Given that the vulnerable component is network-bound, attacks can occur even from external internet sources, emphasizing the important nature of patching. The affected build numbers include [10, 0, 22631, 2715], [10, 0, 19043, 3693], [10, 0, 10240, 20308], [10, 0, 22621, 2715], [10, 0, 19045, 3693], and [10, 0, 22000, 2600], which are addressed by KB articles 5032199, 5032192, 5032190, and 5032189.",
