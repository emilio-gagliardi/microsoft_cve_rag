  "description": "The vulnerability is caused by a flaw in the secure boot implementation, allowing unauthorized access to system resources through type confusion and heap-based buffer overflow conditions. These weaknesses enable an attacker to bypass secure boot, compromising system integrity and confidentiality, especially in environments where users must initiate connections.",
