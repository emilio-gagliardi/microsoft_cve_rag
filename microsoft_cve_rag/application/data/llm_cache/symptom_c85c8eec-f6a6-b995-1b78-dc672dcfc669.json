  "description": "After applying the security update associated with KB-126.0.2592.8 for Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based), users may experience unresponsiveness or delayed loading times within the browser. This is particularly observable when browsing websites that utilize complex scripts or multimedia content. Additionally, users might notice higher-than-usual memory usage leading to slowdowns, especially on machines with limited resources. The issue seems to affect build numbers 126.0.2592.8 and 126.0.2592.81, creating a frustration among end users who expect prompt performance from their web browsing experience. As a result, the impact from this update could disrupt normal workflows for users and administrators alike.",
