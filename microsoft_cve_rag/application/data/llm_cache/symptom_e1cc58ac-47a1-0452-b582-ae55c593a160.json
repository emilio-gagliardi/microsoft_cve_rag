  "description": "Windows endpoints running the CrowdStrike Falcon agent are experiencing critical issues after recent updates on July 18, 2024. Affected systems may display error messages on a blue screen, specifically error codes 0x50 or 0x7e, and can enter a state of continual restarting that prevents normal operation. This problem necessitates recovery operations to restore functionality. Multiple build numbers for Windows, including versions 11 and 10, as well as several Windows Server versions are impacted. Microsoft has released KB articles KB-5042426 and KB-5042421 providing guidance on troubleshooting and resolving these issues.",
