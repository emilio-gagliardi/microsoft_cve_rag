  "description": "End users may experience a total loss of availability when interacting with systems using the Windows mobile broadband driver. This can manifest as an inability to access network resources, as the driver may be exploited to deny service effectively. Specifically, users on affected builds, including Windows 10 versions 22H2 (10.0.19045.5011) and 21H2 (10.0.19044.5011), as well as various Windows 11 builds (e.g., 10.0.26100.2033, KB5044284, etc.), could find themselves unable to connect to the internet or other services reliant on the mobile broadband interface. This reflects a significant disruption that can impact productivity and connectivity. Users might not be able to establish new connections or lose ongoing ones, creating a frustrating experience when attempting to utilize broadband services.",
