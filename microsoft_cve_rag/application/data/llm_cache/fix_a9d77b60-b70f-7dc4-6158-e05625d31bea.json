  "description": "**Fix Overview**:\n\nTo configure LDAP over SSL on domain controllers (DCs), perform the following steps:\n\n1. Open the 'Manage Computer Certificates' tool from the Start menu on each DC.\n\n2. Expand the 'Personal' certificates section.\n\n3. Import the certificate that includes the private key.\n\n4. Double-click the imported certificate and confirm that:\n   a. The General tab indicates you have a private key that corresponds to this certificate.\n   b. The Certification Path tab shows a valid path, with each item indicating 'This certificate is OK' under the Certificate Status box at the bottom.\n\n5. Reboot the DC and repeat the above steps on each DC.\n\n**Details**:\n- These instructions prioritize importing into the local computer's personal certificate store rather than the NTDS personal store, as the latter involves more complex steps to access. Be sure to follow Microsoft's official guidance at the provided link if needed. \n",
