  "description": "The symptom arises when a system administrator is unable to verify if the winre.wim file is properly patched against known vulnerabilities, specifically CVE-2022-4109 and CVE-2024-20666. This can lead to potential exploitation of these vulnerabilities, particularly affecting Windows 10 and Windows Server 2022 environments. Ensuring that the winload.exe file and BootMenuUX.dll are up-to-date is critical, as they are addressed through cumulative Safe OS updates, which may not be easily checked using standard tools like dism.exe.",
