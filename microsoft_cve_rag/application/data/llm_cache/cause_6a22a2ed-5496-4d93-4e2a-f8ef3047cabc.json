  "description": "The underlying cause of the issue seems to come from a mismatch in the driver version that was originally installed versus the latest available version from Dell's support site. Although the user had the latest driver installed, reinstalling the driver from a fresh download resolved the issues experienced with the machines running Windows 10 and 11. This indicates that the initially installed driver may have had corrupted files or misconfigurations that were not rectified through simple updates, necessitating a complete reinstallation from a verified source. The importance of using the machine service tag to download the precise driver version is underscored, as incorrect drivers can lead to various system performance issues and malfunctions. Ensuring that the driver alignment with the operating system build numbers is crucial for optimal hardware functionality.",
