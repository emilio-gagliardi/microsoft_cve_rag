  "description": "**Fix Overview**:\n\nTo address the slowness issue after installing the March update on Windows 11:\n\n1. Perform a system file check by running `sfc /scannow` in an elevated command prompt. \n2. Reboot the machine.\n3. Conduct an in-place upgrade to reinstall the Windows operating system, which can refresh its configuration and performance.\n4. After the upgrade, run `sfc /scannow` again to verify system integrity.\n5. Check for and install any additional Windows updates if they are available. \n\n**Details**:\n- This method effectively resolved slowness issues on over 100 machines without needing to address core isolation settings, which some have found ineffective. \n- The in-place upgrade reinstalls Windows while maintaining user data and applications, typically helping restore system performance.
