  "description": "After applying security updates KB-5034763 across various Windows operating systems, including multiple builds of Windows 10 (such as 10.0.19044.4046) and Windows Server 2016 (10.0.14393.6709), users may observe a denial of service impact on the Windows Network Address Translation (NAT) service. This can manifest as a total loss of availability, preventing legitimate users from accessing network resources. Administrators may report system unresponsiveness or an inability to establish new network connections, which hinders essential network services. The issue affects systems with the specified build numbers as well as configurations managed through the NAT service, significantly affecting network traffic under high operational demands.",
