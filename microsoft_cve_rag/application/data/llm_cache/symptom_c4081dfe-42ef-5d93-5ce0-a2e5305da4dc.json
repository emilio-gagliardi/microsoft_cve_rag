  "description": "Users may experience intermittent crashes or a denial of service when using the curl tool on Windows 10 and Windows 11 systems after the installation of specified security updates. This behavior is particularly notable in affected builds including Windows 10 (10.0.19044.3693, 10.0.22000.2600) and Windows 11 (10.0.22621.2715). Users should reference KB5032190, KB5032192, and KB5032189 for the updates addressing this issue. Failure to update may lead to severe limitations in network data operations relying on curl.",
