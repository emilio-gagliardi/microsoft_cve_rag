  "description": "The root cause of CVE-2024-21311 lies within the Windows Cryptographic Services, which contains a flaw that allows information disclosure through improper handling of memory usage. Specifically, the vulnerability can be exploited by a locally authenticated attacker who sends a specially crafted request to a vulnerable function within the Cryptographic provider. This condition may be related to how sensitive data is stored and managed in heap memory, enabling the potential reading of small portions of that memory. It is essential to note that no user interaction is required for exploitation, which increases the likelihood of successful attacks if the appropriate conditions are met. The flaw is present across various Windows builds, including versions for both 32-bit and 64-bit systems, which can exacerbate its impact if not adequately addressed.",
