  "symptom_label": "unauthenticated_access_leads_to_secure_boot_bypass",
  "description": "After applying the recent updates identified in KB5040448 and related articles, end users may experience a critical risk of secure boot being bypassed. This issue pertains to specific Windows versions, including builds 10.0.22631.3880 and 10.0.22621.3880, which are present in Windows 11 Version 23H2 and 22H2, respectively. System administrators should be alert to signs of unauthorized access attempts from users on adjacent local networks, as the vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated user to exploit the situation simply by waiting for an active user session. Consequently, this could lead to significant integrity and confidentiality losses across the system. Users may not immediately notice this security issue until malicious activity is conducted via compromised secure boot protocols.",
