  "description": "Users encounter an issue during the initial setup of their Outlook accounts on Windows 10 and Windows 11, specifically after the installation of May patches. Upon starting Outlook for the first time, after entering the email address, the connection process hangs indefinitely without prompting for the user password. Fiddler inspection reveals that the autodiscover service is not accessed, and the process stops after several GET requests, leading to an eventual HTTP 404 error stating 'we can't connect you right now.' Existing profiles function correctly, indicating that the issue is isolated to new account setups. A workaround involves entering a bogus email to prompt for advanced setup options, allowing users to input the correct email address subsequently and receive the password prompt, facilitating account completion.",
