  "description": "After the update to Microsoft Edge version 127.0.2651.74, users may notice unexpected behavior when interacting with malicious files. Specifically, if an end user opens a file that exploits CVE-2024-39379, this could lead to memory disclosure, potentially revealing sensitive information stored in the system's memory. This impact affects the integrity and confidentiality of the user's data. Users may experience unusual error messages or application instability when attempting to open such compromised files, prompting system administrators to investigate possible memory leaks or security incidents resulting from user actions. It is important to ensure that all users are running the updated version of Microsoft Edge to prevent engagement with these types of vulnerabilities.",
