  "description": "Users of Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) version 128.0.2739.54 may experience application crashes due to underlying heap corruption caused by a heap buffer overflow in the Skia graphics library. This issue, documented under CVE-2024-8198, affects systems that render complex web content. After the affected version was installed, users could observe unexpected terminations of the browser while loading or interacting with specific web pages crafted to exploit this type of vulnerability. To mitigate this, it's critical for system administrators to ensure that users update to the latest version of Microsoft Edge, which has been remediated against this issue with the latest security updates reflected in KB-128.0.2739.54. The observable symptom includes not just crashes but potential loss of unsaved work in the browser, leading to user frustration and disruptions in productivity.",
