  "description": "A critical issue arises when Windows Server 2022 instances upgrade unexpectedly to Windows Server 2025 due to a misclassification of an update, specifically KB-5044284. This security release, which was meant for Windows 11 24H2, inadvertently included an upgrade path for server systems. The error occurred on Microsoft's part, leading the update to be auto-approved by administrators who may not have recognized the implications. This miscommunication can disrupt server operations and lead to unforeseen complications with compatibility and feature sets that differ between the two server versions. The situation necessitates immediate attention from system administrators to prevent potential service interruptions caused by unplanned upgrades.",
