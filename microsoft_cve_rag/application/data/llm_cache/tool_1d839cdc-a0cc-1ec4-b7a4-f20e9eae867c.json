  "description": "**Tool Overview**:\n\nThe Advanced Configuration Editor for ScreenConnect is a tool used within the ScreenConnect remote support software to manage and configure settings related to client updates and other functionalities. \n\n**Details**:\n\n1. This editor allows administrators to enable or disable advanced features, including the ability to automatically update client software when the server is upgraded.\n2. Clients can be automatically updated irrespective of their previous version, which ensures that all connected devices are running the latest software.\n3. Though convenient, enabling this feature may lead to a significant load on the Internet connection, as all clients will attempt to update simultaneously.\n4. This configuration is accessible through the web settings, specifically under the option for 'Automatically Update Agent Version'.\n5. Utilizing this editor optimally requires an understanding of the potential bandwidth impact during large-scale updates.",
