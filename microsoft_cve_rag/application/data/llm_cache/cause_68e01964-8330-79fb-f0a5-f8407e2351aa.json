  "description": "Running Active Directory Sync (AD Sync) on a Domain Controller (DC) presents significant security risks and is not recommended as a best practice. The underlying issue is that this configuration can lead to vulnerabilities, as the DC handles sensitive operations and should not be burdened with AD Sync processes. It is advisable to run AD Sync on a non-DC server, ideally on a dedicated Windows server instance, which enhances security and operational stability. Current best practices dictate that AD Sync is supported up to Windows Server 2019, underscoring the necessity for compliance with these guidelines to mitigate potential security threats. Installation on a dedicated server minimizes the risk of compromising the domain environment due to unexpected issues arising from AD Sync operations.",
