  "description": "After applying the September patch identified as KB5042881, users are experiencing failures when attempting to establish Remote Desktop connections. This issue seems to have been acknowledged due to inconsistencies in the patch notes, where the July patch was noted to address certain problems that are now listed as known issues in the September update. This behavior indicates a regression, as the previously resolved problems have resurged following the update. System administrators should investigate the impact on their environments, especially concerning OS build 20348.2700, and monitor for further updates from Microsoft support regarding this known issue. Users impacted by this problem may encounter difficulties accessing critical resources remotely, thereby affecting productivity and workflows within organizations.",
