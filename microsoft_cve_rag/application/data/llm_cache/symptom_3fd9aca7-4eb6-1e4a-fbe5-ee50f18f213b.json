  "description": "Users of Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) version 128.0.2739.42 may experience UI spoofing as a symptom of the underlying vulnerability reported in CVE-2024-8034. This can manifest as altered or misleading content displayed in the browser, misleading users about their interactions with web pages. The impact of this malfunction can result in unauthorized actions on websites due to the deceptive visual representation. This issue specifically stems from the implementation of custom tabs in the Chromium engine, which is utilized by the Edge browser. Users are advised to check their browser version and update to the latest release to mitigate this behavior, as the updated version resolves this concern.",
