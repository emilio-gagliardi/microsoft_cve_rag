  "description": "Users may experience a critical impact due to the remote code execution risk associated with several Windows operating system versions. This issue affects Windows 10 (version 22H2 and 21H2) and Windows 11 (version 23H2 and 21H2) across both x64 and ARM64 architectures. System administrators should be vigilant as the underlying issue could lead to unauthorized access, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code remotely. Observable behaviors may include system slowdowns or instability if attempts to exploit this vulnerability are actively occurring within the environment. End users may report increased errors or performance issues resulting from potential exploit attempts, necessitating immediate attention to software updates such as KB5037771, KB5037768, and KB5037770 to mitigate these risks.",
