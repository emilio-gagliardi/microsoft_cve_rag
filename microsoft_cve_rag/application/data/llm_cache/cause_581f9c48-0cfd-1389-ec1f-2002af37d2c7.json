  "description": "The underlying cause relates to the updates concerning Windows Certificate-based authentication (KB5014754) and security hardening measures associated with CVE-2023-36871. The default behavior post-installation of updates on server 2019 and above has shifted to selecting strong mapping using x509issuerserialnumber instead of weak mapping, with implications for authentication processes. Additionally, due to CVE-2023-36871, Microsoft has enforced a policy where machines not updated with security patches released post-July 2023 will not be allowed to accept Windows Hello authentication requests, potentially disrupting single sign-on experiences for users. This change emphasizes the need for robust maintenance and regular update deployments on affected systems to prevent authentication failures. The consequences of these updates necessitate a comprehensive review of active directory configurations and Windows security patching protocols as future updates approach, particularly with respect to final enforcement transitioning in 2025.",
