  "description": "To mitigate the issues caused by patching the Hyper-V host on Windows Server 2019, it is recommended to instead patch the virtual machines (VMs) while postponing the host updates until a reliable resolution is provided. This approach helps to prevent triggering the underlying problems that may arise from host patches, as indicated in discussions among users and related forum postings. The suggested workaround maintains the operational stability of VMs by reducing potential disruptions linked to Hyper-V host changes. For further guidance, users can refer to the relevant KB articles, specifically KB-5031361 and KB-5031364, which detail the patching process and its implications for Hyper-V environments.",
