  "description": "The Windows Smart Card infrastructure is affected by CVE-2024-30098, leading to a security feature bypass within the Cryptographic Service Provider (CSP). This issue arises because the smart card certificate propagation service automatically overrides the use of the Key Storage Provider (KSP), limiting cryptographic operations to those provided by the CSP. The problem significantly impacts systems relying on RSA-based certificates. The recent Windows security updates as of July 9, 2024, address this vulnerability by returning control to the KSP for cryptographic functions. System administrators are advised to enable the fix using the specified registry key to ensure maximum security and compatibility across applications dependent on smart cards.",
