  "description": "The underlying issue appears to stem from a misconfiguration in the Windows 2022 VM template. Specifically, the unwarranted bugs or settings present in the initial cumulative update (CU) introduced problematic behaviors. Fortunately, with the installation of a subsequent CU, these issues are resolved. The November CU seems effective in addressing the annoyances observed, thus not reverting to previous states. System administrators must ensure that their VM templates are regularly updated and validated against the latest patching strategies to avoid similar issues in future deployments.",
