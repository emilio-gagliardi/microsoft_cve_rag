  "description": "The root cause of the Microsoft breach stems from weak security practices that were inadequately enforced or implemented, specifically the absence of two-factor authentication (2FA). This vulnerability provided an opportunity for attackers, including state-sponsored threat actors, to exploit password spraying techniques effectively. Without the additional security layer that 2FA offers, accounts remained susceptible to unauthorized access. This incident highlights the critical need for organizations to adopt robust security measures in their authentication processes to mitigate potential breaches. The lack of enforced security protocols correlates with the incident reported, indicating that addressing these practices can significantly enhance overall security posture.",
