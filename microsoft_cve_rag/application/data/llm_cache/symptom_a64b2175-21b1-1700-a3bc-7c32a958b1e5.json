  "description": "After applying the security updates identified in KB articles KB-5044285, KB-5044284, KB-5044280, and KB-5044273, users may notice an elevation of privileges issue affecting the Windows kernel-mode driver across several builds including 10.0.22631.4317 and 10.0.22000.3260. This can lead to unauthorized access to system functionalities, with potential impacts including unauthorized file modifications, increased risk of data leakage, or loss of control over system settings. Users on Windows Server 2012 and various Windows 10 and 11 builds experiencing unexpected behavior following the patches may be particularly affected. As this relates to the use after free vulnerability (CWE-416), administrators may need to monitor their systems closely for any unusual access patterns or unexpected changes in permissions to ensure system integrity is maintained.",
