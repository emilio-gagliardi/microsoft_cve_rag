  "description": "Potential issues may arise if the UEFI firmware version is outdated. The Microsoft Secure Boot keys require that the UEFI firmware be updated to the latest version provided by the hardware vendor or OEM. Failure to do so could lead to incompatibility with secure features intended to enhance system integrity and security. This issue can hinder the system's ability to boot securely and utilize all security features effectively. It is essential for system administrators to regularly check and confirm the firmware version to ensure optimal performance and security compliance.",
