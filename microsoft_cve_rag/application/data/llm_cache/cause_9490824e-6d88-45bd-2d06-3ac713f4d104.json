  "description": "The underlying cause described in this post is related to a boot failure occurring in VMware-based virtualization environments when a virtual machine (VM) configured with an x86-based processor has Secure Boot enabled. This issue arises after applying certain mitigations that are referenced in KB-5025885 and are associated with the changes related to CVE-2023-24932. The application of these mitigations disrupts the Windows Boot Manager\u2019s functionality, preventing affected VMs from successfully booting. Microsoft is aware of the situation and is actively coordinating with VMware to find a resolution to this compatibility issue. This problem is particularly relevant for environments that rely on Secure Boot as a security measure, highlighting the intricate relationship between firmware settings and virtualization compatibility.",
