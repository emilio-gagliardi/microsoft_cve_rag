  "description": "A time-of-check time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition in the Windows kernel allows an attacker with local access to potentially elevate privileges. This occurs when the system checks a condition before performing an operation, and between the check and the operation, an attacker modifies the system state to gain unauthorized access.",
