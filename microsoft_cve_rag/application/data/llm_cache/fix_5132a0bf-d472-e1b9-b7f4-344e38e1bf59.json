  "description": "**Fix Overview**:\n\nTo manage workstation re-joins to Active Directory effectively, create an exception group for trusted users:\n\n1. Establish an exception group in Active Directory.\n2. Add trusted users who require permissions to join computers to the domain into this group.\n3. Reference this exception group in the Group Policy Object (GPO) setting on your Domain Controller (DC).\n4. Ensure the policy is set to 'Allow computer account re-use during domain join'.\n\n**Details**:\n- This method has been validated in enforcement mode over a couple of years and is effective in managing domain joins without unnecessary disruptions. Ensure that you assess the specific needs of your environment to tailor the implementation for best results.\n",
