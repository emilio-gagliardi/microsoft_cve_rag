  "description": "Following the application of the specified security updates, Windows Hyper-V hosts may experience a denial of service. This occurs when the hypervisor becomes unresponsive, preventing access to virtual machines hosted on it. End users may notice that applications running within the virtual machines become inaccessible, leading to interruptions in ongoing operations. The affected Windows builds include 10.0.19044.4894, 10.0.22000.3197, 10.0.22631.4169, and 10.0.26100.1742, associated with KB articles such as KB5043080, KB5043076, and KB5043064. This symptom emphasizes the critical impact on resource availability and underscores the importance of timely updates to avoid such disruptions.",
