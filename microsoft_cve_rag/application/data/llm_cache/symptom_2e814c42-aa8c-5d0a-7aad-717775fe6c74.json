  "description": "After applying the updates referenced in KB-5044285, KB-5044284, KB-5044280, and KB-5044273, users may experience a complete denial of service with the Windows Network Address Translation (NAT) component. Systems running affected build numbers including Windows 11 versions 24H2 (10.0.26100.2033), 23H2 (10.0.22631.4317), and Windows 10 version 22H2 (10.0.19045.5011) may find network connectivity abruptly interrupted. This can manifest as inability to establish new network connections or loss of existing connections, leading to significant disruption in service availability. The impact is severe as it can prevent access to critical resources, necessitating immediate attention from system administrators for remediation. It is crucial for users to monitor their systems closely after applying these updates to mitigate unexpected outages.",
