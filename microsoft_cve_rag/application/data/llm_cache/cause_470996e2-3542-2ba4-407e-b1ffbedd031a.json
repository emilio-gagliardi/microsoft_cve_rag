  "description": "The underlying issue stems from the Windows Boot Manager's handling of secure boot changes, specifically regarding revocations related to CVE-2023-24932. When Secure Boot changes occur, they often require updated certificates to be properly configured in the system's registry. If the registry values are not set correctly, particularly in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE hive, it can lead to boot failures or misconfigurations. The use of the command method mentioned in KB-5025885 is recommended to ensure proper registry updates are applied, specifically setting the 'availableupdates' value as a REG_DWORD. Failure to include necessary steps such as a scheduled task during the update process may also contribute to the problem.",
