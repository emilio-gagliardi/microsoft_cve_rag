  "description": "After applying the security updates associated with this post, users of the Windows Telephony Server may experience unexpected behaviors indicative of privilege elevation incidents. Specifically, unauthorized users might gain access to functions typically restricted to administrative accounts, leading to potential alterations of system configurations or access to sensitive data. This issue is particularly concerning for users on builds [10, 0, 19045, 4291], [10, 0, 19044, 4291], [10, 0, 22631, 3447], [10, 0, 22000, 2899], [10, 0, 22621, 3447], and [10, 0, 10240, 20596], as mentioned in the KB articles KB-5036925, KB-5036894, KB-5036893, and KB-5036892. The elevation of privilege may not immediately manifest as an error message but could become apparent through unauthorized modifications or anomalous behaviors that raise security concerns among administrators. This underscores the importance of applying the recommended updates and continuously monitoring system behavior to mitigate any arising risks.",
