  "description": "The vulnerability in the Windows Ancillary Function Driver for Winsock is caused by a use after free condition that occurs when the driver fails to properly handle memory that has been freed but is still accessed. This flaw allows an attacker with local access to the system to execute arbitrary code or elevate their privileges, potentially leading to system-level access. The affected products include various versions of Windows, particularly Windows Server 2008, 2016, and 11, with specific build numbers documented. The issue is exacerbated by insufficient memory management practices in the driver, which could be exploited under certain conditions, highlighting the need for patches provided in the related KB articles.",
