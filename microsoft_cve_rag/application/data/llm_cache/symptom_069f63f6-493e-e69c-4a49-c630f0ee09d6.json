  "description": "Users may experience failures when attempting to download files using Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) version 122.0.2365.52 due to insufficient policy enforcement in the download mechanism. This issue has been addressed in the latest update (KB-122.0.2365.52), which resolves the ability for remote attackers to bypass filesystem restrictions. Consequently, if an outdated version of Edge is in use, users could witness errors or blocked downloads when interacting with certain HTML documents. As the version is essential for ensuring secure operations, administrators are advised to check their browser's current build and ensure it is updated to at least 122.0.6261.57 to prevent these interruptions.",
