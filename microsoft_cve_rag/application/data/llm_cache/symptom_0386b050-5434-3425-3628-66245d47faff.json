  "description": "Post installation of the security patch outlined in KB5040442, users may observe that the secure boot functionality appears to be bypassed, potentially allowing unauthorized access to system resources. This can manifest as a failure to enforce security protocols for systems configured with Windows 11 Version 23H2 (10.0.22631.3880), 22H2 (10.0.22621.3880), and various Windows 10 builds including 21H2 and 22H2. Administrators, upon updating, may notice that systems do not maintain the expected secure boot states, leading to concerns over compromised integrity and potential system vulnerabilities. There's an implicit risk where unauthorized users with proper network access could exploit this lack of secure boot enforcement to gain access to critical system areas. Such behaviors require immediate attention to ensure updated systems are still compliant with required security measures.",
