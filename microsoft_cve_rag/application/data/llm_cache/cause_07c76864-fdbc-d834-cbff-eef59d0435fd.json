  "description": "The root cause of CVE-2023-6510 is a use-after-free flaw in the media capture component of the Chromium open source software. This condition occurs when the software frees memory resources while they are still in use, leading to potential exploitation by an attacker. The flaw was identified in the Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) product, specifically in build version 120.0.2210.61, which directly ingests matches from Chromium's codebase. The situation was rectified in the security update correlated with KB-120.0.2210.61, which addresses this memory management issue, ensuring that the latest version of Microsoft Edge is secure and not vulnerable to this flaw. Users are advised to ensure they are using this build to mitigate the risks presented by the use-after-free vulnerability.",
