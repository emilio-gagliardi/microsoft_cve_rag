  "description": "Following the update to Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) version 130.0.2849.80, end users may experience unexpected crashes or instability within the browser. This symptom can be particularly noticeable when users attempt to load web pages that were previously accessible, leading to frustration and interruptions in workflow. Inconsistent behavior may also manifest through the browser freezing or hanging during active sessions. Users should ensure they upgrade to the latest version, 130.0.6723.117, to mitigate these issues related to the prior vulnerability. KB Article KB-130.0.2849.80 discusses this update and its aftermath.",
