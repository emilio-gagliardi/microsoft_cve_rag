  "description": "Users may notice an increase in permissions in their Windows environments, leading to unauthorized access to restricted files and settings. This behavior could manifest as users being able to perform actions that require higher system privileges without appropriate authorization, creating potential security risks. As this is related to the NTFS elevation of privilege vulnerability affecting various Windows versions, it may impact users across different builds: 10.0.19045.4412, 10.0.22631.3593, 10.0.22621.3593, and 10.0.22000.2960. Relevant KB articles associated with this issue are KB5037788, KB5037771, KB5037770, and KB5037768, which provide solutions and updates to mitigate this impact.",
