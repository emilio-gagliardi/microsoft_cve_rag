  "description": "After applying updates KB5046613 and KB5046633, users on Windows 10 (versions 21H2 and 22H2) and Windows 11 (versions 22H2 and 23H2) may experience unauthorized access where certain processes gain elevated privileges unexpectedly. This could manifest as regular user accounts being able to execute administrative tasks or access restricted files without appropriate authorization. Administrators may observe unusual activity in system logs indicating unexpected permission levels, leading to concerns about potentially compromised systems or security workflows being disrupted. This issue primarily affects installations with build numbers 10.0.19044.5131, 10.0.22621.4460, and 10.0.22631.4460 where these updates were applied.",
