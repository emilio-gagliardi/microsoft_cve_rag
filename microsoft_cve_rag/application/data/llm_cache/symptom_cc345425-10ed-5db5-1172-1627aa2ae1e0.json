  "description": "After the release of security updates outlined in KB-5041592, KB-5041585, KB-5041580, and KB-5041571, users may notice that their systems are at risk of remote code execution due to vulnerabilities in the Windows Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS). This means that an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on affected systems simply by tricking users into connecting to a malicious server. The risk of unauthorized access leads to concerns about user data integrity and overall system security. Especially in enterprise environments, this could lead to significant disruption and compromise, prompting system administrators to urgently deploy the latest patches to mitigate exposure. The affected builds include Windows Server 2012 R2 and various configurations of Windows 10 and 11, impacting systems running both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures.",
