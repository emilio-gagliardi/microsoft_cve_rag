  "description": "**Fix Overview**:\n\nTo upgrade to ScreenConnect version 23.9.10:\n\n1. Ensure you are currently running version 22.8 or newer to qualify for the upgrade.\n2. If running an older version (6.4 or below), proceed by first upgrading to the last supported version (22.8).\n3. Maintain an active license throughout the process to avoid any legal or authorization errors while upgrading.\n\n**Details**:\n- Active licenses are necessary to upgrade, regardless of your current version.\n- Versions after 6.4 do not allow custom extensions unless they are published through ConnectWise's official marketplace.\n- Be prepared for potential upgrade issues related to license status.\n\nNote: If issues persist, consider reaching out to ConnectWise support for assistance.
