  "description": "**Tool Overview**:\n\nThe URLRewriter is a utility designed to modify and rewrite URLs within email messages to point to relevant resources directly.\n\n***Details***\nThis tool can streamline communication by ensuring that links within emails are updated to reflect current or more relevant destinations. It inspects the body of the email to identify URLs that may require modification and performs the necessary replacements. This is particularly useful when original links point to deprecated resources or require adjustments for better accessibility. \n\nA common use case involves replacing old links with direct links to updated articles or resources, such as those found on the Microsoft Tech Community website. \n\n**Example of Usage**:\n```PowerShell\n# A hypothetical PowerShell implementation of the URL rewriting process\n$emailBody = Get-Content -Path 'C:\temp\recent-email.txt'\n$updatedBody = $emailBody -replace \"https://original-link.com\", \"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com\"\nSet-Content -Path 'C:\temp\recent-email-updated.txt' -Value $updatedBody\n```",
