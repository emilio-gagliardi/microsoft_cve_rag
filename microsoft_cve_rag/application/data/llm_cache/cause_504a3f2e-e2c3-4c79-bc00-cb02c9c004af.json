  "description": "The root cause of the issue with admins' co-managed devices missing endpoint protection policies after applying a Configuration Manager update lies in a defect introduced in an update to a component of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. This defect leads to the unintentional removal of the endpoint protection policies from affected devices, specifically for those managed with Configuration Manager version 2403 or 2309 HFRU. It is essential to note that this issue does not affect other policies or devices managed in Microsoft Intune that are not using the specified versions. As of May 13, 2024, a fix is in the validation stages, with deployment expected to commence shortly thereafter, providing a resolution before May 17, 2024. Administrators can refer to specific known issue KB articles for additional contextual information and mitigation steps.",
