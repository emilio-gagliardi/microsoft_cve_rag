  "description": "Users may experience issues with the Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tool that fails to locate the necessary source files when attempting to perform system repairs or updates. The associated error code 0x800f0989 indicates a problem with the CBS (Component-Based Servicing) handler. When pointing DISM to a mounted ISO as a source, it does not recognize the path, resulting in an unsuccessful operation. This can lead to update installation failures, causing potential disruption to system functionality.
