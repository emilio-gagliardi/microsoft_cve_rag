  "description": "After applying the updates associated with KB-5036910, KB-5036894, KB-5036893, and KB-5036892 on Windows 10 builds 19045.4291, 19044.4291, 22631.3447, 22000.2899, and 22621.3447, users may encounter elevated privilege issues particularly affecting the USB print driver functionality. This can result in unauthorized access levels, leading to potential disruptions in print services. Users might not be able to utilize printer functionalities correctly, thereby impacting workflows that depend on these devices for output. Administrators need to monitor for abnormal access patterns related to print jobs, as these may indicate that the patch did not fully remediate the privilege escalation concerns reported. Ensuring all affected systems are updated promptly is crucial to mitigate these access issues stemming from the vulnerability described.",
