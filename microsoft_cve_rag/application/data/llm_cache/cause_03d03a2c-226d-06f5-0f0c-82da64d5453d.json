  "description": "The underlying cause of the issue with Google Chrome on Server 2022 appears to be related to a misconfiguration introduced during the in-place upgrade from Server 2016, specifically after applying the patch identified by KB-5034129. This patch has inadvertently affected the image file execution options for Chrome, causing it to launch with a complete white screen and crash shortly thereafter. The resolution involves deleting a specific registry key that was autoconfigured by the upgrade process. By removing the registry entry at 'hklm\\software\\microsoft\\windows nt\\currentversion\\image file execution options\\chrome.exe', Chrome can start normally again. This situation highlights the complex nature of upgrade processes and the importance of monitoring post-upgrade behavior when applying new patches.",
