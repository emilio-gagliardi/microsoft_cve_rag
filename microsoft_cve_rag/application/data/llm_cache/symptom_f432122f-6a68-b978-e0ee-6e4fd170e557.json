  "description": "Systems running Windows with the Pragmatic General Multicast (PGM) feature may experience significant risks due to a remote code execution vulnerability identified under CVE-2024-21357. Affected users may notice that certain network services are unexpectedly disrupted or that unauthorized actions can occur on their systems without any user interaction. This vulnerability could lead to complete loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability for the resources managed by the affected services. End users might also observe unexpected behaviors during multicast operations or potential instability in their applications at the layer where PGM operates. System administrators should refer to KB5034763 for mitigation strategies, particularly if using Windows 10 build numbers 19045.4046, 10240.20469, or any listed in the release notes.",
