  "description": "After applying security updates associated with KB-127.0.2651.98, users of Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) version 127.0.2651.98 may notice discrepancies in browser behavior or version reporting. This includes potential misalignment of expected functionality with the newly installed version of Microsoft Edge, leading to frustrations for end users trying to confirm they are running the most secure version. Issues may manifest as slower browser performance, unexpected errors while navigating websites, or failures in loading certain web applications that rely on the latest updates. Users should regularly check their edge settings to ensure they are utilizing the most up-to-date version and to minimize any disruption caused by these update-related discrepancies.",
