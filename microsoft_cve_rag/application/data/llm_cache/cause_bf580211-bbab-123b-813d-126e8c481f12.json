  "description": "The cause of the vulnerability identified in CVE-2023-36025 can be attributed to a flaw in the Windows Smartscreen security feature, which allows an attacker to bypass important security prompts and checks. This situation arises when the affected component is bound to the network stack, making it remotely exploitable via crafted internet shortcuts. The lack of specialized access conditions implies that any user interaction involving clicking on a malicious link can trigger the vulnerability, leading to unauthorized access to protected resources and denial of integrity and availability. This affected various Windows build numbers including 10.0.22631.2715, 10.0.19043.3693, 10.0.10240.20308, 10.0.22621.2715, 10.0.19045.3693, and 10.0.22000.2600, and is addressed in KB-5032199, KB-5032192, KB-5032190, and KB-5032189.",
