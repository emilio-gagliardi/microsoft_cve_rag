  "description": "After applying the security update addressed in KB5044285 and related articles, users may experience unexpected behavior where local users possess escalated privileges on affected systems. This could manifest as unauthorized access and control over privileged system resources for the user making the interaction, especially on Windows 10 and Windows 11 builds, such as 10.0.19045.5011 and 10.0.26100.2033. Administrators may observe that certain user actions previously restricted to elevated accounts can now be performed by standard users. Such behavior could culminate in systems that seem to intermittently allow unauthorized commands to execute, which could lead to potential data exposure or changes in system integrity. It is crucial to ensure that all mentioned patches are appropriately deployed to restore intended access controls and prevent any potential exploitation.",
