  "description": "The cause of the vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the Windows Link Layer Topology Discovery Protocol. It occurs when an attacker sends malicious networking packets to a targeted adjacent system. This exploit takes advantage of the network stack's behavior, allowing code execution when a user is running network mapping functionality over a vulnerable Wi-Fi adapter. The attacker must be within proximity to the target system to execute this attack.",
