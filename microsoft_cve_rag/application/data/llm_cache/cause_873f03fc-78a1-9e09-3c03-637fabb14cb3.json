  "description": "The underlying cause of this issue is an out-of-bounds read vulnerability in the Windows USB Video Class system driver, which can potentially allow an attacker to elevate privileges. This occurs when the driver fails to properly validate the size of input data, consequently leading to reading beyond the intended memory limits. The vulnerability is present in multiple Windows 10 and Windows 11 builds, which increases the risk if unpatched. Attackers need physical access to exploit the flaw by connecting a malicious USB device, which triggers the vulnerability and allows unauthorized system privileges to be obtained.",
