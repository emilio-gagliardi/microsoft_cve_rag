  "description": "After installing the May 2024 Windows non-security preview update (KB5037853), users of Windows 11 versions 23H2 and 22H2 may experience issues with the taskbar. Symptoms include the taskbar glitching, becoming unresponsive, or disappearing entirely before reappearing. This behavior may also trigger application errors logged as 'Event ID 1000' in the Event Viewer, with 'explorer.exe' noted as the faulting application and 'taskbar.view.dll' as the faulting module. Affected users are advised to utilize the Known Issue Rollback (KIR) to mitigate the issue, which can take up to 24 hours to propagate automatically. For immediate resolution, users on Windows Home or Pro editions, as well as non-managed devices, must restart their systems, while IT administrators can apply a special group policy to address the problem more swiftly.",
