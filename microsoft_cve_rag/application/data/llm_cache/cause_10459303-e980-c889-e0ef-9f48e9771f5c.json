  "description": "The Windows Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS) contains a numeric truncation error due to improper handling of data, leading to potential remote code execution. This flaw occurs when inputs are processed that are not adequately validated, causing the misinterpretation of data sizes and types, ultimately allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system when a client connects to a malicious server.",
