  "description": "After applying the security updates related to the Microsoft SQL Server ODBC driver identified in KB-5036925 and others, users may experience intermittent network connectivity issues when utilizing applications dependent on this driver. Symptoms could manifest as failure to connect to the database or timeouts during data retrieval processes. This can lead to disrupted workflows, affecting productivity as end-users encounter obstacles in accessing critical database resources. Furthermore, in certain build environments, such as 10.0.19045.4291 and others listed, this symptom could vary in severity, emphasizing the need for immediate attention in enterprise-managed deployments. Administrators should monitor for disruptions and ensure that dependencies on the ODBC driver are accounted for in their maintenance plans.",
