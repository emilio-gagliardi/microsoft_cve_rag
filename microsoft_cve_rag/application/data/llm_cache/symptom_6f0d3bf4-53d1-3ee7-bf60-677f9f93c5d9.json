  "description": "After applying the updates detailed in KB-5038530 for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central, users may experience issues related to authentication failures. This symptom can manifest as users being unable to log in or access certain functions within the application due to improper authentication mechanisms. Specifically, the builds affected include 22.13.64344, 24.1.19498, and 23.7.18957 corresponding to the 2023 and 2024 release waves. These issues arise when the elevation of privilege vulnerabilities impact user accessibility and system functionality. System administrators should monitor user feedback regarding access issues following the application of the security updates, as affected functionalities can create significant workflow interruptions.",
