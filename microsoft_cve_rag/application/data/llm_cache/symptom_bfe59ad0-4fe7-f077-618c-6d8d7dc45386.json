  "description": "The observed symptom is that devices running Windows 10 22H2 are unable to successfully upgrade to Windows 11, even though they meet the necessary specifications for the upgrade. The issue persists despite attempts to resolve it through standard troubleshooting methods such as DISM, SFC, and driver updates. Users are experiencing repeated failures of the Windows 11 upgrade process, leading to potential data loss and the need for reinstallation of the previous operating system version.",
