  "description": "Users experience unexpected behavior in applications relying on Remote Procedure Call (RPC) mechanisms, which may manifest as application crashes or inability to connect to services. This issue arises following updates that include changes to the RPC runtime where compatibility with certain types is not properly managed. Affected products include Windows 10 builds 19045, 19044, 22631, 22000, 22621, and 10240. End users may find that software fails to respond or operates incorrectly when attempting to invoke services. As a result, normal workflows are disrupted, causing frustration for both end users and system administrators.",
