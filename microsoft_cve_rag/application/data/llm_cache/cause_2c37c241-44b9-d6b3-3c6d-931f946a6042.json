  "description": "The issue stems from a heap-based buffer overflow in the Windows Telephony Service, allowing remote code execution through network interactions. Specifically, if a user connects to a malicious server, it can return harmful data leading to arbitrary code execution on the client's system. This vulnerability affects builds 10.0.26100.2314, 10.0.22631.4460, 10.0.22621.4460, and incorporates KB articles KB-5046696, KB-5046633, KB-5046617, and KB-5046613, thus requiring a fix via official updates.",
