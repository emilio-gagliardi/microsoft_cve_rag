  "description": "The rollout of the new Teams client by Microsoft has led to reported instances of Microsoft Teams disappearing from user devices. Users observed that once the rollout was blocked in the Teams admin panel, these incidents ceased, suggesting a direct correlation between the deployment of the new client and its erratic behavior on systems. Possible factors contributing to this issue include conflicts with existing installations on Windows 10 or 11 and limitations in the functionality of the Microsoft Store for Business.",
