  "description": "To mitigate the HTTP/2 Rapid Reset Attack (CVE-2023-44487), it's essential to install the latest Windows updates corresponding to KB-5031364 for Server 2022, KB-5031361 for Server 2019, and similar updates for other affected products. These updates introduce new registry keys that allow administrators to control the maximum number of reset streams per minute, offering a new level of configurability. Specifically, the registry key 'http2maxclientresetsperminute' can be set to values between 0 and 65535, along with 'http2maxclientresetsgoaway', which determines if a 'goaway' message is sent to clients once the limit is reached. Furthermore, for added protection, disabling the HTTP/2 protocol can be achieved via the registry editor, ensuring a robust response to the attack vector.",
