  "description": "End users may experience unexpected application crashes or performance degradation when using the Microsoft WDAC OLE DB provider for SQL Server. This behavior is observed particularly in build numbers [10, 0, 19045, 4291], [10, 0, 19044, 4291], [10, 0, 22631, 3447], [10, 0, 22000, 2899], [10, 0, 22621, 3447], and [10, 0, 10240, 20596]. Administrators could see errors indicating failed database connections or disruptions in data retrieval process, directly impacting business operations. Additionally, inconsistent response times from database calls may be noticed during peak operations. For detailed remediation and updates, refer to KB articles KB-5036925, KB-5036894, KB-5036893, and KB-5036892.",
