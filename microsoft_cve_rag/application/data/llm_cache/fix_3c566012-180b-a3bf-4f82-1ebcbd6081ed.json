  "description": "**Fix Overview**:\n\nTo mitigate potential data leaks from Microsoft Copilot in your environment, consider disabling the following components:\n\n1. Use Group Policy to disable the standalone app, the module within Windows Search, and the Microsoft Edge browser hubs sidebar module that includes Bing Chat/Copilot/ChatGPT.\n\n2. Ensure that you have the most recent Administrative Templates (ADMX/ADML) for Windows 10 22H2 and Windows 11 23H2, as well as for Microsoft Edge. This is critical for having the necessary policies to manage these features.\n\n**Details**:\n- If you lack the appropriate MS 365 licensing (E3, E5, A3, Business Standard, or Business Premium), the risk of accidental leakage of intellectual property/confidential company data is significantly heightened. \n- Updating the Administrative Templates can be done by visiting the official Microsoft download links.\n\nFor the Windows 11 23H2 templates, refer to this link: [Download Windows 11 Templates](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=105667).\n\nFor the MS Edge for Business templates, use this link: [Download Edge Business Templates](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/business/download?form=ma13fj).
