  "description": "After installing the security update identified by KB-116.0.1938.81, users may experience unexpected crashes in Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) versions 116.0.1938.81 and 116.0.1938.98. This behavior is a direct result of a heap buffer overflow issue that was exploited in the wild before the update. The affected build numbers for systems are 116.0.1938.81 and 117.0.2045.31. Users are advised to check their browser version and ensure they are updated to mitigate this issue effectively.",
