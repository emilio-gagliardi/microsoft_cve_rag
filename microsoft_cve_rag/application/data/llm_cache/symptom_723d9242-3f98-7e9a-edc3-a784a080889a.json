  "description": "Users may notice unauthorized access to sensitive areas of their systems following the application of the latest security update. With the recent patch KB-5034123 applicable to Windows 11 versions 23H2 for x64-based systems and KB-5034122 for Windows 10 version 22H2 for both 32-bit and x64-based systems, there may be instances of privilege escalation activities appearing in user sessions. This could lead to unexpected behaviors where users are unable to trust the integrity of their system since elevation of privileges can allow for modifications that are generally restricted. Users on systems running builds including 10.0.19045.3930 and 10.0.22631.3007 might encounter altered access controls or the appearance of unauthorized applications behaving as if they have higher privileges. Such observable behaviors are critical as they may indicate that system protections are being circumvented, impacting both user trust and system reliability.",
