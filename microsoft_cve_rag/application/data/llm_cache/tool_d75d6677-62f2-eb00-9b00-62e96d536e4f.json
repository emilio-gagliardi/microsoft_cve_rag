  "description": "**Tool Overview**:\n\nThis PowerShell script facilitates the process of mounting a Windows ISO image and initiating an installation or upgrade process. It automates the typically manual steps involved in using an ISO image, making it easier for IT administrators to update or install Windows on multiple machines.\n\n**Details**:\n\n1. **Copy the ISO**: The user must first copy the Windows ISO file to a specified location on the machine.\n2. **Mount the ISO**: The script uses the `mount-diskimage` command, which allows for mounting the ISO without a drive letter initially.\n3. **Retrieve Volume Information**: Once the ISO is mounted, the script retrieves the volume information using `get-volume`, which provides the necessary details to assign a drive letter.\n4. **Assign Drive Letter**: The `mountvol` command is used to assign a unique drive letter to the mounted ISO, allowing easy access to its contents.\n5. **Start Setup Process**: Finally, the setup process is initiated with the relevant parameters, ensuring a quiet installation that accepts the end-user license agreement automatically.\n\nThis approach is beneficial for large-scale deployments, where manual setup would be cumbersome and time-consuming. It is also designed to be wrapped in a foreach loop for batch operations.\n",
