  "description": "After the installation of the security update, users may experience problems with Hyper-V virtual machines where security features regarding isolation and integrity can be compromised. This could manifest as unexpected behavior in virtual machine operations, particularly if a user reboots their machine. Furthermore, there may be reports of connectivity issues or restricted functionality due to the nature of the bypass vulnerability. Users on systems running Windows 11 (versions 24H2, 23H2, and 22H2) and Windows 10 (version 22H2) are particularly affected, with corresponding updates identified in KB5044284, KB5044285, and KB5044273. The observed behaviors signal a potential elevation of risk concerning virtual environment security post-update.",
