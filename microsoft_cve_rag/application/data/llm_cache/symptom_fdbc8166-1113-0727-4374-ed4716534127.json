  "description": "Users may experience unauthorized remote command executions on their Windows 10 and 11 systems due to a flaw in the Windows mobile broadband driver. This behavior can manifest as unexpected system control by an external attacker, potentially leading to manipulation or access of sensitive data without user consent. Affected build numbers include several versions across Windows 10 (e.g., 10.0.19045.4412, 10.0.19044.4412) and Windows 11 (e.g., 10.0.22631.3593, 10.0.22000.2960) as outlined in associated KB articles, including KB5037771, KB5037768, and KB5037770. System administrators should remain vigilant for signs of unauthorized access or unusual system behavior following updates that might introduce this issue.",
