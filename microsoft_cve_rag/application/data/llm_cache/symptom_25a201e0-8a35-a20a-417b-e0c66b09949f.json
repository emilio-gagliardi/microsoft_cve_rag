  "description": "The issue described pertains to the impact on client and server updates when utilizing Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager (MECM). Concerns were raised about how these updates will be managed in a hybrid work setup and what specific challenges might arise. In particular, the questions centered on whether a dual approach is necessitated for patch management. The setup suggests potential complications that could lead to delays or failures in the deployment of critical updates, affecting both end-user devices and servers. Regardless of the exact scenarios, the post emphasizes that system administrators must be vigilant in addressing this uncertainty to ensure seamless updates within their environments.",
