  "symptom_label": "domain_join_operation_fails_due_to_policy_restrictions",
  "description": "The domain join operation can fail when local accounts attempt to initiate this privileged action, especially if there are strict policies in place that prevent the creation or joining of computer accounts. This process is halted if the current policy does not allow the machine to join the domain, indicating that policy management is crucial in ensuring proper domain functionality. In situations where the join status is flagged as 'dirty', users may still be able to login with cached domain accounts, but ultimately, this does not allow for proper domain membership. The failure to adhere to the necessary policy configurations can lead to difficulties in organizational compliance and domain management. System administrators must ensure that policies are correctly configured to avoid disruption in joining machines to the domain.",
