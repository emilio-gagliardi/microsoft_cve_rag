  "description": "The observed behavior indicates that users attempting to upgrade Windows from version 21H2 to 23H2 need to install the Enablement Package (EKB W11 21H2 to W11 23H2). Without this critical package, the upgrade process may not proceed smoothly, leading to potential upgrade failures or interruptions. Such symptoms are particularly relevant for systems operating on Windows 10 version 21H2 transitioning to Windows 11 version 22H2, underscoring the importance of the EKB to facilitate proper version upgrades.",
