  "description": "The New Outlook and New Teams applications are experiencing issues due to their automatic update feature. System administrators are seeking methods to disable these auto-updates through various management policies, including Intune and Group Policy. This persistent update behavior could disrupt user workflows or introduce inconsistencies across device environments. It calls for targeted policy adjustments to manage the updates effectively and maintain system stability in enterprise deployments. Administrators must evaluate their current configuration and consider user impacts stemming from unverified updates.",
