  "description": "After installing the security updates KB-5047621, KB-5046696, KB-5046633, KB-5046613, and KB-5044285 on Windows 10 (including builds such as 10.0.22631.4317, 10.0.22621.4317, and 10.0.19045.5011), users may experience system malfunctions, including unexpected reboots and failures in applications to launch properly. These impacts may interfere with normal operations such as tasks requiring security features or network services, possibly leading to prolonged downtimes or degraded user experience. Reports indicate instances of processes hanging or software failing to respond following the update installation. The observed issues suggest a disruption in standard operation, causing alarm for system administrators and requiring immediate attention for remediation.",
