  "description": "End users may experience unauthorized access to sensitive data as an attacker can utilize a spoofing technique to intercept and manipulate network communications within the system. This can result in critical information being revealed without the user's knowledge, creating serious privacy implications. Systems affected include Windows 10 and Windows 11 across several build numbers, specifically versions 10.0.22631.4317, 10.0.22621.4317, 10.0.26100.2033, and more. The impact can lead to a total loss of confidentiality, making it imperative for organizations to apply the security updates provided in KB-5044285, KB-5044284, and KB-5044280 to mitigate this threat. Administrators should remain vigilant for any unusual access patterns or signs of a man-in-the-middle attack on their networks following the update.",
