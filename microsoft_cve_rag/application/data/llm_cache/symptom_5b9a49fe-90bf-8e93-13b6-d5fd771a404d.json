  "description": "Users of Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) version 127.0.2651.74 may experience instability in the browser, particularly when interacting with specific UI elements on web pages. This instability could manifest as the browser crashing or freezing unexpectedly, creating a frustrating experience for the end users. Additionally, users might notice errors or inconsistent behavior when rendering CSS elements, potentially impacting the layout of websites. It is advised that users update their browser to the latest version available to mitigate these issues, as earlier builds may contain components vulnerable to heap corruption as described in CVE-2024-7000, which is addressed in KB-127.0.2651.74. The successful application of this update is essential for maintaining a stable and secure browsing environment.",
