  "description": "The recent patch specified in KB-5036979 introduces a set of more vulnerable drivers that will be disabled during the update process. This change significantly impacts systems, particularly in environments such as hospitals where outdated hardware is frequently in use. Many older systems running Windows 7 may rely on these drivers to function correctly. The implementation of this patch, without thorough pre-deployment testing, could lead to widespread operational disruptions, as crucial devices or software associated with legacy drivers may no longer work post-update. System administrators should be aware of the potential failure of essential equipment, which could cost over a million euros, affecting patient care and operational efficiency.",
