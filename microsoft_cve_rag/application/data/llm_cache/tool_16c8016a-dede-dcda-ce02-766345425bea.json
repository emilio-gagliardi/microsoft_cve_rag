Additionally, the use of 365 ADMX templates simplifies the application of group policies, allowing for easier adjustments as organizational needs change.\n\n**Usage Example**:\n1. Open the Group Policy Management Console.\n2. Locate the policy for Microsoft Teams.\n3. Enable the requisite settings found in the 365 ADMX templates.\n4.
