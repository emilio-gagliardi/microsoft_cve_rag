  "description": "**Fix Overview**:\n\nTo resolve issues with printer functioning on a Windows 10 Pro 22H2 system, utilize the Windows built-in troubleshooter. This tool can clean up conflicting printer names and restore proper functioning to the printing system.\n\n1. Open the Troubleshooter by navigating to Settings > Update & Security > Troubleshoot.\n2. Select 'Printer' from the list of troubleshooters and follow the on-screen instructions to clean up the printer names and configurations.\n\n**Details**:\n- The troubleshooter may take some time to complete the cleanup process effectively. \n- Ensure that any third-party printer management applications (like HP Smart) are uninstalled to prevent conflicts.\n- This method helps in redirecting print jobs accurately to the intended default printer.\n\n**Preconditions**:\n- No HP print management software should be installed on the system prior to running the troubleshooter for best results.",
