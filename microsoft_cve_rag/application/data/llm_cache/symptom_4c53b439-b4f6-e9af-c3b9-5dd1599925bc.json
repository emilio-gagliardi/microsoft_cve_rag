  "description": "Users of Outlook, particularly in environments using Exchange Online, experience disappearing calendar meetings, a symptom that can potentially disrupt scheduling and collaboration. The problem occurs randomly, and affected users notice that meetings they've created or accepted vanish from their calendars without apparent reasons. Examples include instances where a user creates a meeting that initially appears on their calendar, only to disappear shortly after sending invites. Similarly, meetings accepted by users can also vanish, leading to confusion and missed appointments. This symptom has been noted in various versions of Microsoft Office, including Office 2016, 2019, and 2021, all reportedly up to date. The issue appears irrespective of user devices, but there are indications that calendar sync conflicts\u2014especially with iPhones\u2014may exacerbate the situation, suggesting a potential link with mobile device management settings or configurations.",
