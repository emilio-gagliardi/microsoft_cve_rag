  "description": "The post describes an occurrence of Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) impacting multiple systems linked to CrowdStrike operations. System administrators report an immediate error response that disrupts operations, specifically seen when attempting to boot normally. The issue requires intervention through the Windows Recovery Environment to access and modify system files. The suggested workaround involves navigating to the CrowdStrike driver directory and deleting a specific file with the name pattern 'c - 00000291*.sys' to mitigate the BSOD error. This indicates a problem with the CrowdStrike driver that necessitates administrative action to restore normal system functionality.",
