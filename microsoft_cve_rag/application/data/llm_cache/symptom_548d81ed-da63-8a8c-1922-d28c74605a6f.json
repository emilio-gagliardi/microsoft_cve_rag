  "description": "After applying the security patch KB5040442, users may experience unexpected behavior where the operating system allows unauthorized elevation of privileges. This could manifest as unauthorized access to certain system resources or settings that should typically require elevated administrative rights. Users on systems such as Windows 11 (build 22631.3880, 22621.3880) and Windows 10 (build 19045.4651, 19044.4651) may find that certain applications can perform actions beyond their intended permissions. This could result in significant security risks, as malware or unauthorized users could exploit the situation. Continuous monitoring and verification of user permissions are advised to ensure the integrity of affected systems.",
