  "description": "**Fix Overview**:\n\nTo manage Windows 10 upgrade processes effectively within an Active Directory (AD) environment:\n\n1. Create an AD machine group specifically for Windows 10 systems instead of relying on individual Organizational Units (OUs).\n2. Utilize this machine group to filter updates and upgrades.\n3. Monitor the group; when Windows 10 machines are upgraded and removed, the associated machine group will automatically be purged.\n\n**Details**:\nThis method streamlines the upgrade management process and ensures that only relevant systems are targeted for updates, reducing administrative overhead.
