  "description": "Users may experience instability with Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) version 128.0.2739.42, where the browser may crash or fail to open after a security update is applied. This behavior is potentially linked to insufficient data validation in the V8 API, which can lead to heap corruption, especially when using certain Chrome extensions. This impact is particularly noticeable when users attempt to access online applications or websites that rely on the functionality of these extensions. The issue was mitigated in more recent Chromium versions, specifically 128.0.6613.84 released on August 22, 2024, following the discovery of the associated CVE-2024-7974. Administrators should ensure their users are on the latest build to prevent encountering such crashes and improve browser reliability.",
