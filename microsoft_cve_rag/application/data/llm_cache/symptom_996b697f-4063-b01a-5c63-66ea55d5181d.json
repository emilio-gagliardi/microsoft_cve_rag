  "description": "End users may observe unexpected behavior regarding print jobs, as the Windows Print Spooler service experiences issues, potentially leading to an unauthorized elevation of privileges. This can manifest as unauthorized users gaining access to sensitive printing functionalities or being able to manipulate print queues. Depending on the build numbers affected, users may witness malfunctioning print services which could cause notebooks and documents to stall or fail altogether during printing tasks. Notably, this impact affects multiple Windows versions, including Windows 10 (build numbers 10.0.10240.20526, 10.0.19044.4170), Windows Server 2012 R2, and others mentioned in the KB articles such as KB-5035959 and KB-5035854, which detail the related security updates and rollups necessary to resolve these critical issues.",
