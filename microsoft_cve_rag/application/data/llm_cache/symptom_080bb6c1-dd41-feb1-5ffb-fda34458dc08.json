  "description": "Users are experiencing a recurring issue with 789 VPN errors when attempting to connect to L2TP VPNs. This problem seems to have resurfaced, similar to issues encountered the previous year, indicating a potential regression or an unresolved bug affecting the connection stability. The error hampers users' ability to establish secure connections to necessary resources and could signify underlying configuration issues or compatibility concerns with the network transport protocols. It's critical for system administrators to assess the VPN settings on both client and server sides to identify the direct cause of these errors. Monitoring logs and user reports can provide insights into any patterns or changes that might correlate with this issue.",
