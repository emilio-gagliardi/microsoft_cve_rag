  "description": "The root cause of the elevation of privilege vulnerability (CVE-2024-20683) is found in the Win32k component of Windows. This component manages many user interface aspects of the operating system and enables potential attackers, with local access to the machine, to manipulate read, write, and execute privileges incorrectly. An attacker could exploit this flaw by accessing the target system locally via a console or by tricking a legitimate user into executing a malicious action, thus circumventing intended security measures. The flawed interaction with user inputs allows unauthorized access levels, enabling the attacker to gain system-level privileges, which can lead to severe impacts on confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system resources managed by the Win32k component. The affected products are Windows 10 and Windows 11 across several specific build numbers, with corresponding KB Articles providing the necessary remediation steps.",
