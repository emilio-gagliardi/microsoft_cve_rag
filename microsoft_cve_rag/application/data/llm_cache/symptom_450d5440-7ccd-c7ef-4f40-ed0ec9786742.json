  "description": "After applying the updates corresponding to KB-5036896, KB-5036894, KB-5036893, and KB-5036892 on systems running Windows 10 (Builds: 19045.4291, 19044.4291, 22631.3447, 22000.2899, and 22621.3447), users may experience unexpected information disclosures through the Desktop Window Manager (DWM). This could result in sensitive data being revealed during the operation of applications utilizing the DWM core library, especially when multiple applications are open simultaneously. The presence of out-of-bounds read conditions in the library may lead to unauthorized access to memory addresses, potentially leaking user data. Administrators should monitor for unusual application behavior or data disclosures following these updates, as they highlight a critical issue that needs immediate attention.",
