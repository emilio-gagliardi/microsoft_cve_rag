  "description": "The Extended Security Updates (ESU) program is an annual subscription service provided by Microsoft that allows organizations and individual consumers to continue receiving critical and important security updates for Windows 10 PCs that have reached the end of support. This service ensures ongoing protection for systems that cannot be immediately upgraded and provides a measure of security against new vulnerabilities during the transition period. Enrolling in the ESU program helps mitigate risks associated with using unsupported software and can be a critical part of a long-term strategy for managing legacy systems.",
