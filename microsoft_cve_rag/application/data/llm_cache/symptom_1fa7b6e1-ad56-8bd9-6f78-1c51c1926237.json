  "description": "Users may experience a situation where they are prompted to click on a specially crafted URL, which, if acted upon, allows an attacker to initiate remote code execution on their system. This observable behavior mainly affects users of specific Windows builds, including Windows 11 Version 24H2 (build 10.0.26100.1457) and Windows 10 Version 22H2 for x64-based Systems (build 10.0.19045.4780). Consequently, an affected system could display error messages about potential security issues or compromised functionality should the user inadvertently assist in the execution of harmful code. It is crucial that system administrators ensure users are made aware of the need to avoid such links, as successful exploitation can lead to significant system impacts such as loss of confidentiality and integrity as documented in KB5041571 and other associated KB articles.",
