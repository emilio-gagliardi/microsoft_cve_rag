  "description": "After applying the 2023-10 Cumulative Update (KB5031364) on Microsoft Server Operating System version 21H2 for x64-based Systems, previous versions of AuthLite will fail, preventing 2022 Domain Controllers from booting or authenticating users. The issue arises from modifications in the kdcsvc.dll file specific to the 2022 DCs. It is critical to upgrade to AuthLite version 2.4.14 or newer to resolve the problem and ensure proper startup and authentication functionality.",
