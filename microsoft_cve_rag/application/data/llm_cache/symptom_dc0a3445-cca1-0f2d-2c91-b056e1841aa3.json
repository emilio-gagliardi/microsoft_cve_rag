  "description": "Users may experience significant concerns regarding sensitive data exposure due to the underlying vulnerability in the Windows Distributed File System (DFS) as identified in KB-5036896. When exploited, there is a potential for total loss of confidentiality, meaning that sensitive information could be disclosed to unauthorized individuals. This could manifest as users receiving reports of data breaches or notifications about unauthorized access to confidential files stored within the DFS. Administrators may find themselves scrambling to identify the extent of the data exposure, leading to potential operational disruptions and trust issues within the organization as the risks associated with sensitive data becoming public can severely impact business continuity and reputation. The impacted Windows Server products include Server 2019 (10.0.17763.5696), among others, reinforcing the importance of applying the provided security updates promptly to mitigate risks.",
