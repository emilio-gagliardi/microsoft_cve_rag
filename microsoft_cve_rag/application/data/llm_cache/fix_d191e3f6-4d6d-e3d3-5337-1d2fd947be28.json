  "description": "Utilize osdupdate in conjunction with PowerShell to retrieve all applicable updates for Office 2016 from 2015 onwards. This process involves repackaging Office 2016 to ensure that refreshed or newly imaged devices come pre-loaded with a comprehensive set of updates. By scripting the installation process, administrators can streamline the deployment of updates, minimizing manual intervention. The procedure also allows for manual installation by placing the necessary .msp files in the designated updates folder. Familiarizing oneself with this workflow can save significant time and effort in managing Office updates for new installations.",
