  "description": "The underlying cause of the issue relates to the requirement for enabling the virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM) in vSphere when using certain configurations of virtual machines (VMs). Incorrect configurations such as failing to access the latest VM version and the correct OS version can lead to operational problems. Additionally, enabling features like UEFI and virtualization-based security (VBS) is essential for Windows Server, especially for the updates to be applied securely. A noted caveat is that updating VMware Tools from vCenter cannot occur when VBS is enabled, which is a design decision. Adhering to these recommendations is particularly important for ensuring the security posture of Windows Server 2022 and future iterations like Windows Server 2025.",
