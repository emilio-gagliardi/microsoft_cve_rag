  "description": "The underlying cause of the installation failure associated with the observed error message is a misconfiguration related to Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) and Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager. The security update in question, identified by KB-5034441, concerns the Windows recovery environment for Windows 10 versions 21H2 and 22H2, which was published on January 9, 2024. Users must ensure that their synchronization settings in WSUS are correctly configured to include the appropriate product classifications, specifically for 'Windows 10, version 1903 and later' under the 'updates' classification. If these configurations are not aligned, the update will not sync properly, leading to installation contention. This misalignment can be traced back to settings that are not commonly adjusted by system administrators, underscoring the importance of verifying WSUS and Configuration Manager settings regularly.",
