  "description": "Users may find that their systems are not being offered the Windows 11 upgrade due to the TPM chip being disabled in the BIOS. Disabling the TPM chip causes the device to be recognized as incompatible with Windows 11, preventing the upgrade offer. When users are ready to upgrade, they will need to re-enable the TPM chip in the BIOS to allow for compatibility and installation of Windows 11.",
