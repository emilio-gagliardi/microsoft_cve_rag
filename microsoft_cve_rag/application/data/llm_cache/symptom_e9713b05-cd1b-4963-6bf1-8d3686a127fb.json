  "description": "End users may notice that Microsoft Edge crashes unexpectedly when attempting to load specific websites that utilize complex scripts. This behavior is particularly prevalent in versions prior to 125.0.6422.76 and 125.0.2535.67, where the browser demonstrates instability due to a type confusion issue in the Chromium engine. Users may encounter application hangs or forced close incidents, leading to frustration and potential loss of work. It is essential for administrators to ensure that Edge is updated to the latest version to mitigate these issues. This information is vital to maintaining a stable browsing experience within enterprise environments.",
