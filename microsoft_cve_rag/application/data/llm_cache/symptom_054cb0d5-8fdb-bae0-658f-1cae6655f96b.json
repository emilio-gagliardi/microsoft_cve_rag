  "description": "Users are reporting difficulties in accessing Extended Security Updates (ESUs) for Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2012 R2 via Azure billing accounts. This issue may prevent administrators from maintaining compliance and receiving critical security updates necessary for the ongoing support of these legacy systems. It is crucial for environments still dependent on these older operating systems to explore alternative methods for obtaining updates if they are unable to utilize Azure billing channels effectively.",
