  "description": "Users may experience unexpected behavior related to elevated privileges on Windows systems due to the impact of the win32k elevation of privilege vulnerability (CVE-2024-20683). This issue affects multiple builds, including Windows 10 (10.0.19044.3930, 10.0.19045.3930) and various Windows 11 versions (10.0.22000.2713, 10.0.22631.3007). If exploited, attackers could gain elevated resources or capabilities that should be restricted, possibly allowing unauthorized access to sensitive information or control over system processes. System administrators might notice anomalies in user permissions, applications behaving unexpectedly, or alerts related to unauthorized access attempts. This situation may necessitate immediate patching through updates identified by KB articles 5034121, 5034122, 5034123, and 5034134 to mitigate the risk associated with this behavior.",
