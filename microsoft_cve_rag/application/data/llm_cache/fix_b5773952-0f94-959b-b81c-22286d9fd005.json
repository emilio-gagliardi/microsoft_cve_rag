  "description": "**Fix Overview**:\n\nTo address potential security issues related to the Jan 2024 Cumulative Update for your Domain Controllers (DCs), it is recommended to review and modify the settings concerning implicit owner privileges related to the ntSecurityDescriptor attribute.\n\n1. Check the configuration of your directory services to see if they allow implicit owner privileges during LDAP add and modify operations.\n2. If enabled, consider disabling this setting to enforce per-attribute authorization, as the current configuration is deemed insecure and should only be used temporarily.\n3. Refer to the suggested mitigations provided in the following link for further guidance:\n   [Mitigation Guidance](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2174032).\n\n**Details**:\n- The current setting does not block requests but logs warnings, which can present a security risk over time. \n- If your dsHeuristics AD attribute is \u201cnot set,\u201d assess if it needs to be configured based on the recommendations in KB-5008383.\n- Understand that while these warnings are generated, they do not stop operations but indicate that further action may be necessary to ensure the security of your AD environment.
