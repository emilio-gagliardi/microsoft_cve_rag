  "description": "The underlying issue leading to CVE-2024-20691 is a race condition in the Windows themes handling component. This flaw allows an attacker to exploit the system locally or with minimal interaction, where they could access the process heap memory, potentially leading to the disclosure of both initialized and uninitialized data. The flaw is situated in components responsible for managing user interface themes, where an improper synchronization may allow overlapping access to memory regions during their processing. The affected systems include Windows 10 (build numbers such as 10.0.19044.3930), Windows 11, and Windows Server versions specified in the post. The situation is further complicated by the requirement of low user privileges, which means even users with basic access rights could exploit this defect, thereby exposing sensitive data without the need for additional user interaction.",
