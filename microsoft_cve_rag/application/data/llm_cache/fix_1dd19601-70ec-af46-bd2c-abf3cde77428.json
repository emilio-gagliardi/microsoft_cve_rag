  "description": "**Fix Overview**:\n\nTo effectively block Microsoft CoPilot during regular business hours:\n\n1. Implement Software Restriction Policies (SRP) within your organization's Group Policy.\n2. Create a rule to block the CoPilot application entirely.\n\n**Details**:\n- Software Restriction Policies provide a mechanism to specify which applications can run and under what circumstances. This method helps in controlling user access to specific applications.\n- It is advisable to review and test the policy in a non-production environment to ensure that it does not inadvertently affect other applications or services. (LLM Synthesized)\n\n**Preconditions**:\n- Ensure you have administrative access to the Group Policy Management Console.\n- Test the SRP in a controlled group before rolling it out organization-wide.",
