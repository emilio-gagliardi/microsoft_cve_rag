  "description": "Users may experience failures in the Windows Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS) as a direct consequence of remote code execution risks identified in KB5039212. Affected users, particularly those running Windows 10 versions 22H2 (10.0.19043.4529) and earlier builds (10.0.22000.3019, etc.), might observe irregularities such as service interruptions, degraded performance during network access, or, in extreme cases, a complete inability to establish network connections. These symptoms can manifest through erratic behavior when attempting to deploy remote access configurations or troubleshoot connectivity issues. System administrators are advised to monitor the RRAS service after applying the relevant updates to ensure operational integrity and to mitigate potential disruptions caused by exploitation attempts.",
