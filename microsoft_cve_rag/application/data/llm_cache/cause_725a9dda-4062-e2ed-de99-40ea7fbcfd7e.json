  "description": "The cause of CVE-2023-36400 is rooted in a flaw within the Windows operating system's HMAC key derivation process, which allows for an elevation of privilege during local system access. This vulnerability is significant as it can be exploited without user interaction once access is gained to the system. Attackers can escalate their privileges by executing specially crafted applications, potentially gaining system-level access and affecting resources beyond the initially compromised system. This issue affects multiple builds across Windows 10 and Windows 11, specifically build numbers 10.0.10240.20308, 10.0.19043.3693, 10.0.22000.2600, and later builds. Relevant knowledge base articles include KB-5032199, KB-5032192, KB-5032190, and KB-5032189, which provide patches for remediation.",
