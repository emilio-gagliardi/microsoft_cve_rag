  "description": "**Tool Overview**:\n\nThis tool pertains to the process of updating UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) and Intel Management Engine (ME) firmware. This update is significant as it can resolve various issues related to system functionality and stability on managed devices.\n\n**Details**:\n\nUpdating UEFI and Intel ME firmware involves several key actions:\n1. **Firmware Retrieval**: Obtain the latest UEFI firmware from the manufacturer or authorized channels. Ensure that the firmware version is specifically for your hardware model.\n2. **Update Process**: Follow the manufacturer's instructions to update the UEFI firmware. This typically involves creating a bootable USB drive with the firmware files or applying the update through the system\u2019s BIOS setup tool.\n3. **Post-Update Verification**: After the update, verify the firmware version and ensure that all related features, including firmware TPM (Trusted Platform Module), are enabled and functioning correctly to support system security features.\n\nThis tool is essential for maintaining device stability and security, especially as vulnerabilities in older firmware versions can lead to exploitation if not addressed timely.",
