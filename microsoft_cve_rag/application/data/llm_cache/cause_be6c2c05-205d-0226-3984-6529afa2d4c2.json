  "description": "The underlying cause of CVE-2023-36406 is a flaw in the memory handling of Windows Hyper-V, which potentially allows for unauthorized read access to kernel memory from user-mode processes. This flaw is marked by inadequate isolation between user-mode operations and kernel-mode memory, leading to the inadvertent disclosure of sensitive data. The issue is found in the following build numbers: 10.0.22631.2715, 10.0.22000.2600, and the Windows Server 2022 version discussed in KB articles KB-5032192, KB-5032190, and KB-5032198. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability through local access methods, and it poses a significant confidentiality risk by exposing kernel memory content to malicious users. The use of strict access control, alongside improved memory management techniques, would help mitigate these risks effectively.",
