  "description": "Systems running Windows 11, specifically version 24H2 (build number 10.0.26100.2314), version 23H2 (build number 10.0.22631.4460), and version 22H2 (build number 10.0.22621.4460), may experience significant denial of service issues as a result of the vulnerability described in this post. The observable behavior includes a total loss of availability, wherein end users are unable to access resources, leading to disruptions in workflow. This impact can either be persistent, maintaining unavailability after an attack, or sustained, with ongoing accessibility issues while the attack is executing. Administrators should be vigilant and monitor for these signs, as they could affect operations critically during peak usage times.
