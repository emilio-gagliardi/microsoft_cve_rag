  "description": "Upon exploitation of the Windows TCP/IP stack, end users may experience concerns regarding data privacy, as sensitive information could be disclosed potentially exposing parts of the heap memory. This situation might lead to an increase in anxiety among users and administrators about the security of their systems, prompting administrative actions such as immediate patch deployments. Systems affected include various builds of Windows 10 (notably build 10.0.22631.3880), Windows 11 (including builds 10.0.19045.4651 and 10.0.22000.3079), and several server editions. The Microsoft Knowledge Base articles related to this issue includes KB5040442, KB5040431, and KB5040427 which outline mitigation strategies and updates. As this issue involves information disclosure without impacting system availability or integrity, it is critical for system administrators to assess their environments for possible vulnerabilities caused by this exposure.",
