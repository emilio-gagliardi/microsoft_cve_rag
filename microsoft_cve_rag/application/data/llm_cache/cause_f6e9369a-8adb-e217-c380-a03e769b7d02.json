  "description": "The issue arises from a heap-based buffer overflow in the Windows Link Layer Topology Discovery Protocol, which allows an unauthenticated attacker on an adjacent network to send crafted packets that can result in remote code execution. This vulnerability is strictly tied to configurations that allow network mapping functionalities, increasing exposure under proximity conditions.",
