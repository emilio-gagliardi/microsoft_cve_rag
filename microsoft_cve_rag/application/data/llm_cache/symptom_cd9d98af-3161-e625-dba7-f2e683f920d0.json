  "description": "After applying the security updates detailed in KB5041571, KB5041585, and others, users may experience an elevation of privilege where unauthorized access to system functionalities is possible. This could result in a situation where standard user operations can escalate permissions without the usual constraints, leading to potential unauthorized modifications or access to sensitive areas of the operating system. Specifically, this issue is observed in Windows 11 versions 24H2 and 23H2, as well as Windows 10 version 22H2. The affected build numbers include 10.0.26100.1457 for Windows 11 and 10.0.19045.4780 for Windows 10, indicating a serious operational risk for environments relying on these versions. System administrators must take swift action to deploy the security patches to mitigate this risk effectively.",
