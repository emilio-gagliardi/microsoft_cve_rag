  "description": "The underlying cause of CVE-2024-20699 is a flawed interaction mechanism in Windows Hyper-V that allows an authenticated attacker to execute a specially crafted application on one Hyper-V guest. This flaw can lead to denial of service by potentially interacting with processes of another Hyper-V guest hosted on the same Hyper-V host. The vulnerability stems from the insufficient boundary management between virtual guests, which is exploited via the local attack vector where the attacker can either access the target system directly or through remote means like SSH. This issue is worsened by the low complexity of the attack, allowing unauthorized users with basic privileges to influence the availability of the Hyper-V environment. The result is a total loss of availability for the affected component, demonstrating the critical need for timely updates and security patches to remediate these concerns.",
