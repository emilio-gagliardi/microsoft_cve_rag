  "description": "Users of Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) version 128.0.2739.42 may experience issues with cross-origin data processing due to an insufficient policy enforcement flaw present in the underlying Chromium version. This can lead to unexpected data leaks when engaging with web applications, affecting data integrity and user privacy. End users might notice abnormal behavior when attempting to transfer data between different origins, including error messages or data not being processed as expected. The issue is particularly evident in various UI gestures that might otherwise function seamlessly. The presence of this flaw necessitates users to ensure they are on the latest version of Microsoft Edge to avoid potential data leakage as detailed in KB-128.0.2739.42.",
