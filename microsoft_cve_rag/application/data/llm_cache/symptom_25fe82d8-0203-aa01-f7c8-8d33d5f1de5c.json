  "description": "In certain scenarios involving Windows cumulative updates, both virtual machines and physical machines may experience functionality issues. This has been noted specifically following the February and May cumulative updates. The prescribed workaround includes reverting to previously saved gold images of the virtual machines, which subsequently resolves the issue. Additionally, a related problem within a virtual machine pool was addressed by removing enforced Windows Defender ASR rules that had been set via Group Policy Object (GPO). The overall implication is that updates can introduce instability in various deployment environments, necessitating fallback strategies.",
