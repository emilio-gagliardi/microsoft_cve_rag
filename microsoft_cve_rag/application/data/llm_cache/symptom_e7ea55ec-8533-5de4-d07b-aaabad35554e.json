  "description": "The system incorrectly identifies various printers as HP models, which leads to unintended consequences. Specifically, this misidentification triggers the Microsoft Store to automatically install the 'HP Smart' application, under the assumption that an HP printer is in use. This behavior affects both Windows 10 and Windows 11 environments, causing confusion for users and potential misconfigurations in device management.",
