  "description": "The underlying cause identified in the January 2024 Cumulative Update (KB-5008383) pertains to the nTSecurityDescriptor attribute's configuration in Active Directory. This configuration allows implicit owner privileges during LDAP add and modify operations, which constitutes a security issue as it does not enforce per-attribute authorization. Consequently, warning events are logged without blocking the requests, creating potential exposure for misuse. The recommendation is to use this configuration as a temporary troubleshooting step only, underlining its insecurity. For entities reliant on effective directory security management, this lack of enforcement can lead to unauthorized access unless properly mitigated as noted in KB-2174032.",
