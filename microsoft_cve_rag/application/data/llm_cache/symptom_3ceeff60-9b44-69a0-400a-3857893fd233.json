  "description": "In the October 10 update, the Kerberos protocol management process entered a 'full enforcement' phase, which resulted in the registry key being ignored. Previously, the registry key could be manually set to override default settings, allowing for flexibility during the update progression. Since the enforcement phase began, any manual changes made through this registry key are no longer effective, as detailed in KB-5020805.",
