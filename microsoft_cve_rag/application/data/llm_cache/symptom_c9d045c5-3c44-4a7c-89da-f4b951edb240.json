  "description": "After the application interacts with a malicious SQL Server database via an OleDB connection, users may experience unexpected application behavior, such as unresponsive interfaces or crashes. The issue manifests following attempts to establish a connection that could be compromised, particularly when running on affected builds of Windows 10 and Windows 11, specifically build numbers 10.0.19043.4529, 10.0.22631.3737, 10.0.22621.3737, and 10.0.22000.3019. Users may encounter erratic application performance, indicating that the underlying code execution security flaw has been exploited. This impact is crucial to recognize as it could lead to unauthorized actions being executed on the system as a direct result of these connections, requiring urgent remediation through updates like KB-5039212 and KB-5039211.",
