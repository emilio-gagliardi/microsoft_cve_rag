  "description": "End users may experience issues with the Microsoft Edge browser, including potential crashes or unexpected behavior when using versions that are vulnerable to exploitation, specifically build numbers prior to 125.0.6422.76 or 125.0.2535.67. The impacted system could display error messages related to stability or security when attempting to load specific web pages. Users running affected versions may notice that their browsing experience is compromised, leading to slow load times, failures when accessing secure sites, or anomalous pop-up alerts. As a result of the underlying use-after-free vulnerability inherent in earlier Chromium builds, users are advised to update promptly to the latest version, as indicated in KB-125.0.2535.67, to mitigate these concerns.",
