  "description": "After the installation of security updates KB5040442, KB5040431, and KB5040427 on Windows versions 10 (builds 19044.4651, 19045.4651) and 11 (builds 22621.3880, 22631.3880), users may experience elevation of privilege. This occurs when a crafted JSON file, if opened, may allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access and control of the system, leading to significant risks such as unauthorized file modifications, deletions, or access to sensitive data. The exploitation of this vulnerability can result in total loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of resources, severely affecting the system's performance and reliability. This issue highlights the importance of ensuring that updates are applied correctly to mitigate potential exploitation risks.",
