Ensure that your systems are up-to-date with the latest patches released by Microsoft, specifically addressing the vulnerabilities CVE-2024-30051 and CVE-2024-30040.\n2. For browsers, prioritize updating Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge to resolve associated zero-day vulnerabilities, including CVE-2024-4671 and CVE-2024-4761.\n\n**Details**:\n- The elevation of privilege vulnerability (CVE-2024-30051) in the Windows DWM core library is crucial, as it can allow attackers to gain system privileges.\n- The security feature bypass vulnerability (CVE-2024-30040) also poses risks by potentially allowing attackers to bypass mitigations in Microsoft 365 and Office applications.\n- It is recommended to assess the impact of these vulnerabilities and apply the patches as a high-priority task to secure enterprise environments against possible exploits.\n",
