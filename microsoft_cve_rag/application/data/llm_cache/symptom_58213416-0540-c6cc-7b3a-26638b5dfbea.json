  "description": "After applying the latest patches KB5044284 and KB5044285 for Windows 11 and the associated updates for Windows 10, end users might notice unusual behavior within their SQL client applications. These patches address a critical issue involving the WDAC OLE DB provider for SQL Server, which may allow unauthorized remote code execution. Users could experience unexpected code execution when connecting to malicious SQL databases, where arbitrary commands might be executed within the context of their applications. This could manifest as unusual application behavior or unauthorized access to sensitive data, making it critical for administrators to ensure that all affected systems are updated to the specified build versions to mitigate this risk.",
