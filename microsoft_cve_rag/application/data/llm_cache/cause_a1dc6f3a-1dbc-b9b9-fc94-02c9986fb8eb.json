  "description": "A spoofing vulnerability in Microsoft Edge allows attackers to inject content that can deceive users into thinking they are interacting with a legitimate permission prompt or dialog. This occurs when a specially crafted website or content script is presented to the user, making it possible to spoof the UI elements that show the origin of the prompt, thus potentially misleading the user about the action being taken.",
