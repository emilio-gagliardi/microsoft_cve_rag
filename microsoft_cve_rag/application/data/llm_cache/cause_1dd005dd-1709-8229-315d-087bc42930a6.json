  "description": "The underlying cause of the issue is that being a domain-joined device no longer exempts users from being prompted to upgrade to Windows 11. This change is attributed to Microsoft's recent policy alterations, which have been referred to as their latest 'shenanigans.' Specifically, users who are part of a domain may face unexpected upgrade notifications, leading to potential disruptions in user experience and operational workflows. This behavior was noted in relation to the KB4069463 article, which discusses significant modifications in upgrade invitations. This adjustment affects all domain-joined Windows devices as Microsoft navigates its approach towards Windows 11 integration.",
