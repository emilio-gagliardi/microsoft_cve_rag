  "description": "Users may experience intermittent access problems when using Windows SMB file shares, potentially leading to elevation of privilege issues. This has been observed in builds numbered 10.0.10240 and 20596, which are commonly used in enterprise environments. System administrators should be aware of the impact on user credentials and file permissions, especially in business-critical applications. Additionally, it is advisable to consult KB-5036925 for detailed mitigation steps, as these issues can compromise the overall security posture of the system. Regular updates and monitoring are recommended to ensure a stable operating environment.",
