  "description": "Users of Microsoft Edge for iOS version 126.0.2592.56 may experience a troubling situation where the browser fails to present a critical permissions dialog when attempting to download content. This behavior occurs due to a spoofing vulnerability (CVE-2024-30057), which allows attackers to bypass the standard security prompt, leading to potential loss of integrity and confidentiality. This means users may unknowingly download malicious content without the typical safeguard that informs them of the action being taken. The lack of this warning could expose users to risks such as connecting to harmful websites or executing unintended downloads. It is imperative for system administrators to ensure their environments are updated with the latest security patches to mitigate this risk.",
