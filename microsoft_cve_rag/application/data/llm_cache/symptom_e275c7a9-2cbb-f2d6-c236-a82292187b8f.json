  "description": "The issue arises when the auto start function for Microsoft Teams is not correctly disabled across all user accounts as intended by a group policy. Previously, this functionality was manageable via group policy settings that altered the startup registry key. However, due to the transition of Teams to an AppX package, this registry key modification approach is no longer effective. The work-around involves pushing a specific Group Policy Object (GPO) to change a registry value located at 'HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\LocalSettings\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Appmodel\\SystemAppData\\msteams_8wekyb3d8bbwe\\TeamsTfwStartupTask', where setting the value to 1 disables auto start and 2 enables it. This symptom can affect user experience negatively when Teams launches automatically without proper control.",
