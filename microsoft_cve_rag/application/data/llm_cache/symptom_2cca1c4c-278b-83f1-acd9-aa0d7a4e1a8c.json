  "description": "Users may experience situations where unauthorized access becomes possible due to an elevation of privilege in the Windows Win32 kernel subsystem. This behavior can manifest in the form of unexpected permission changes on sensitive system resources, allowing potentially harmful actions by a regular user. As a result, malicious activities can be performed without appropriate authorization, raising serious security concerns. This issue primarily impacts systems running specific builds of Windows 10 and 11, specifically those associated with KB Articles: KB5043080, KB5043076, KB5043067, and KB5043064. Affected build numbers include 10.0.22621.4169, 10.0.22000.3197, and 10.0.26100.1742, among others. System administrators should monitor user permissions and privileges closely following this update to prevent potential exploitation.",
