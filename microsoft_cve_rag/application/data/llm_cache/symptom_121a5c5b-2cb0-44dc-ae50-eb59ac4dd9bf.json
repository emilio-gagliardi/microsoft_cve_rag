  "description": "Users may encounter authentication failures when accessing Outlook on Server 2019, particularly when conditional access policies are implemented. This issue is evident when the sign-in prompt states, 'manage this device or just this app', potentially blocking further access. Additionally, authentication requests may route through the UK instead of the expected US servers, leading to user confusion and potential latency in service. System administrators are advised to inspect unattended logs for signs of issues with user sign-in, which may provide further insights into failures. It's crucial to temporarily exempt source IPs from SSL decryption or MITM testing to determine if these practices are contributing to the 404 errors experienced by users.",
