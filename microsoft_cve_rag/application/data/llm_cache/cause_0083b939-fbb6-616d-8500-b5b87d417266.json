  "description": "The underlying cause of CVE-2023-36394 is a flaw in the Windows Search Service that allows for an elevation of privilege through a race condition exploit. This condition permits an attacker with basic user privileges to execute arbitrary code with elevated permissions, impacting resources managed by the same security authority. The vulnerability is particularly concerning as it can be exploited locally, meaning an attacker may leverage direct access or manipulate user actions to trigger the vulnerability. The impact affects multiple build numbers, including Windows 10 (builds 10.0.10240.20308, 10.0.19045.3693) and Windows Server 2016 (build 10.0.14393.6452). The associated KB Articles are KB-5032199, KB-5032192, and KB-5032189 which provide details on mitigations and fixes for this issue.",
