  "description": "To successfully integrate the latest cumulative update (LCU) for Windows 22H2, users should use version 22621.2428, with a minimum version of 22621.2283. This allows for the effective addition of the cumulative update followed by the installation of the enabling package (EKB). Users have the option to either utilize the 22621.1 install.wim or any updated version of the 22621.xxxx install.wim to start from scratch. This method ensures a smooth configuration without encountering compatibility issues during the installation process. It is important to adhere to these version specifications to mitigate potential problems during future updates.",
