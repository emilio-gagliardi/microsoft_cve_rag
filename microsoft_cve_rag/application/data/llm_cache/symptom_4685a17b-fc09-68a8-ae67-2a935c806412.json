  "description": "Windows Server 2022 is unexpectedly auto-upgrading to the 2025 version, which can disrupt ongoing server functions. This condition is particularly concerning for system administrators who rely on WSUS computer groups for patch management and updates. The unplanned upgrade could lead to system instability or incompatibility with applications designed for previous versions. The need to implement filtering mechanisms within WSUS indicates that current settings are inadequate to prevent these upgrades. This situation mirrors previous challenges faced when Windows 10 upgraded to Windows 11 without user consent, leading to operational issues.",
