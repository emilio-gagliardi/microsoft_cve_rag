  "description": "End users may experience unexpected access to system resources following the installation of security updates identified in KB5043080, KB5043076, and KB5043067. Specifically, systems running Windows 11 Version 24H2 (10.0.26100.1742), Windows 11 Version 23H2 (10.0.22631.4169), and earlier Windows 10 versions may face elevated privileges allowing unauthorized modifications to files and settings. This could manifest as alterations in user permissions, access to sensitive system files without appropriate authentication, and overall system instability due to improper access management. System administrators should closely monitor user permissions and system behaviors post-update to detect any anomalies that suggest unauthorized privilege escalation.",
