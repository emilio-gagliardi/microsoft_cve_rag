  "description": "Full remote execution and control vulnerability is present in unpatched ScreenConnect servers, allowing attackers to gain unauthorized access. The flaw enables radical control over managed endpoints by allowing the creation of super-admin accounts within the application. Huntress's reverse engineering work has demonstrated this vulnerability in instances where servers are unpatched and login credentials are absent. The critical nature of this issue has led to proactive outreach to clients, as they identified about 1000 servers still vulnerable. The urgency escalated further when the first reported attack took place shortly after announcements were made regarding the vulnerability.",
