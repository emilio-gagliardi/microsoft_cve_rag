  "description": "The underlying issue arises from inconsistent behavior when connecting to LDAP services using either the 389 startTLS or 636 LDAPS protocols. Users have reported that utilizing varying connection methods, such as IP addresses or fully qualified domain names (FQDN), yields inconsistent success rates. However, utilizing the actual domain in a round-robin configuration significantly improves reliability. This indicates that hostname resolution could be a contributing factor to the challenges experienced. Furthermore, validating the SSL certificate presented through tools like OpenSSL helps ensure the integrity of the connection to the domain controllers Certificate Authority (CA) certificates.",
