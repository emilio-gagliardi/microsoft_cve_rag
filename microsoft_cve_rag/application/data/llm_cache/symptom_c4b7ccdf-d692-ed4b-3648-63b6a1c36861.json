  "description": "Users of Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) version 127.0.2651.74 may experience UI spoofing, potentially leading to deceptive user interactions. This symptom arises from an inappropriate implementation in the Chromium component fedcm, allowing a malicious actor to manipulate the browser interface through crafted HTML pages. As a result, users might be tricked into entering sensitive information in fraudulent interfaces that appear legitimate. To mitigate this risk, it is recommended that users ensure their browser is updated to the latest version, which no longer inherits this vulnerability. The relevant KB article for this update is not strictly provided, but reference to security update guides confirms the importance of the build number 127.0.2651.74 in addressing this concern.",
