  "description": "After the application of all designated mitigation steps, a user reported an inability to boot from any available WinPE boot media following the implementation of a revocation step. This issue affects both custom-built WinPE media and those created by endpoint management software tools. The symptom results in potential downtime for system administrators as they are unable to access recovery options or perform system repairs on the affected laptops. Without reliable access to boot media, troubleshooting becomes significantly more complex, highlighting the critical nature of maintaining functional recovery tools in enterprise environments. System administrators should ensure all steps in mitigation processes are carefully evaluated to avoid such issues.",
