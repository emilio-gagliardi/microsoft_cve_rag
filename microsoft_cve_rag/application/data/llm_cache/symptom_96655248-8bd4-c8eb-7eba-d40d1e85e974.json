  "description": "Users of Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) version 126.0.2592.68 may experience visual misrepresentation of critical elements within the user interface after interacting with specially crafted URLs. This spoofing behavior means that users may not see accurate information displayed on certain web pages, potentially leading to confusion and a lack of trust in the browser's output. While the patched version addresses the issue, prior to its application, the UI may show manipulated or covered elements that may mislead users. Therefore, some end users might inadvertently act on misinformation displayed through the browser due to compromised UI integrity, as highlighted in KB38093.",
