  "description": "**Tool Overview**:\n\nA procedural guideline aimed at ensuring proper auditing of unexpected privileges in Active Directory.\n\n***Details***\n\nThis procedure outlines the steps for system administrators to follow when utilizing audit mode to detect unexpected privileges. If the audit mode does not yield any unexpected privileges over a specified duration, the transition to enforcement mode is advised to mitigate potential negative results. Administrators are encouraged to report any anomalies directly to Microsoft through a premier support case or via the feedback hub. This tool serves as an essential part of managing Active Directory security compliance, particularly in relation to CVE-2021-42291. Note that enforcement mode will be enabled by default in future updates from January 9, 2024, ensuring tighter security postures against privilege escalation threats.",
