  "description": "Users of the Microsoft Edge browser may experience UI spoofing incidents as a result of the underlying permissions issue associated with chromium versions prior to 128.0.6613.84. This can result in a misleading appearance of the browser interface, potentially leading users to interact with malicious elements that appear legitimate. This issue impacts Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based), particularly those running build 128.0.2739.42. Users accessing compromised HTML pages may notice discrepancies in navigation or prompts, which can undermine confidence in the browser's integrity. The issue was addressed in a security update released on August 22, 2024, outlined in KB-128.0.2739.42.",
