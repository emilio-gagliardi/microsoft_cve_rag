  "description": "The new Outlook client poses risks to user security and privacy by transferring user emails to the Microsoft cloud without explicit consent. This behavior can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information, increasing the vulnerability of users' data. System administrators may face challenges in ensuring the compliance of this software with organizational policies regarding data protection and privacy. As a result, administrators should evaluate the implications of using this client in their environments, especially in scenarios involving sensitive or confidential information. Continued usage may expose critical data and lead to potential breaches of security protocols.",
