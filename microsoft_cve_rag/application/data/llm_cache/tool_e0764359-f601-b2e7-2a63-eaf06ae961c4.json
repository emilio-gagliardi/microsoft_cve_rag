  "description": "**Tool Overview**:\n\nThe `fsutil` command is a built-in Windows utility that allows administrators to manage file system properties and configurations directly from the command line. One of its functionalities is to determine the available space on a specified disk volume, which is particularly useful for troubleshooting partition issues, especially when dealing with the Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE).\n\n**Usage**:\n\nTo check the free disk space on the WinRE partition, you can use the following command:  \n```cmd\nfsutil volume diskfree \\\\?\\globalroot\\Device\\HarddiskVolumeX\n```\nReplace `X` with the appropriate volume number corresponding to your WinRE partition. This command provides detailed information regarding total space, free space, and used space, making it easier to manage disk configurations.\n\n1. **Backup**: Always back up critical data before manipulating partitions.  \n2. **Adjacent Partitions**: Ensure the WinRE partition is adjacent to the main partition (e.g., C:) for resizing tasks.  \n3. **Validation**: Use the provided command to validate the partition sizes before attempting any resizing.\n\nThis method can resolve various issues related to the inability to re-size the C: drive.",
