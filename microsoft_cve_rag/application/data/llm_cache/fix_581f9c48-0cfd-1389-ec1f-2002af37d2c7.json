  "description": "**Fix Overview**:\n\nTo enhance Windows security and authentication for systems impacted by recent CVEs:\n\n1. Install the February 13, 2024, or later updates on Windows Server 2019 and above, and on supported clients with the Remote Server Administration Tools (RSAT) optional feature installed.\n\n2. Ensure that the certificate mapping in Active Directory Users & Computers is set to default to strong mapping using x509IssuerSerialNumber instead of weak mapping.\n\n3. For devices running Windows, update to security updates released in July 2023 or later to avoid being affected by the security hardening changes for Windows Hello authentication requests, which will fully start enforcing restrictions on February 15, 2024.\n\n4. Review and prepare for the secure boot manager changes associated with CVE-2023-24932 and the enforcement of the code integrity boot policy after updates.\n\n5. Transition away from TLS 1.0 and 1.1 in Azure storage accounts, as support for these protocols will be removed starting November 1, 2024.\n\n**Details**:\n- Full enforcement mode for certificate-based authentication will occur by February 11, 2025, or later. Ensure all devices can strongly map certificates to avoid authentication denial. (LLM Synthesized)\n\n**Preconditions**:\n- Backup relevant data prior to updates.\n- Ensure administrative privileges for the update installations.",
