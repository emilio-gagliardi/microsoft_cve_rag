  "description": "The underlying cause relates to incorrect ownership settings for devices managed through Intune. When a device is not properly assigned to an owner, it may lead to issues in policy application and device functionality. The problem can be mitigated by changing the owner either via the Intune console or by employing Microsoft Graph. This issue highlights the importance of configuration correctness within Microsoft Intune deployments to ensure seamless management and operation of devices. Regular audits of owner assignments may also prevent such misconfigurations from affecting device performance and compliance.",
