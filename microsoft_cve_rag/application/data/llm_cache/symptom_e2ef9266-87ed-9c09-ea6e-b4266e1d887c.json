  "description": "After the installation of specific security updates (KB-5035858, KB-5035854, KB-5035853, KB-5035845), users may experience unauthorized execution of code within the context of applications interfacing with the Microsoft ODBC Driver. This could manifest as unexpected application behavior, potentially leading to data corruption or unauthorized data manipulation. Users may notice activities occurring without their explicit initiation, which raises concerns about system integrity. Specific builds affected include Windows 10 versions (10.0.19045.4170, 10.0.19044.4170, 10.0.10240.20526) and Windows 11 versions (10.0.22631.3296, 10.0.22621.3296). The severity type has been classified as important due to the significant risk of remote exploitation in enterprise environments.",
