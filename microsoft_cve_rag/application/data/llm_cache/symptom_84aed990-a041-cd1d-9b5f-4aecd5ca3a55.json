  "description": "Users of Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) version 128.0.2739.42 may experience instability and potential crashes when accessing specific web pages containing malicious content, due to an inappropriate implementation in the Chromium engine (CVE-2024-7965). This flaw could lead to observable disruptions, such as the browser becoming unresponsive or exhibiting unexpected behavior when rendering crafted HTML pages. It is crucial for system administrators to ensure that their users are updated to the latest version to mitigate any negative impacts, as previous versions might still be vulnerable. The security update KB-128.0.2739.42, released on August 22, 2024, addresses these issues, thereby enhancing browser stability and user experience.",
