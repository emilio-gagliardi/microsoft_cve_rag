  "description": "Users may experience access denial to secure boot provisions resulting in an inability to boot systems securely after applying the patch for CVE-2024-37989. The symptom is particularly noticeable on Windows 10 and Windows 11 systems as identified by various build numbers including 10.0.22631.3880 and 10.0.19045.4651. Users will notice that their devices do not transition to the expected secure operating environment, leading to potential security risks and operational bottlenecks. This behavior is critical when end-users attempt to initiate secure sessions or transactions. Further information can be found in KB articles KB-5040448 and KB-5040442 which provide context and remediation guidance for impacted builds.",
