  "description": "The user is experiencing an issue with their Windows 10 laptop failing to boot, likely due to the absence of a BitLocker recovery key. The device, a Surface, was previously acquired from an organization, and the user is no longer affiliated with them, resulting in the inability to retrieve the key needed for decryption. Attempts to uninstall a recent update from the device did not resolve the boot issue, leaving the user unable to reinstall Windows 10. Furthermore, there is uncertainty around the installation process given the current state of the device. This problem affects devices utilizing BitLocker for disk encryption, especially in scenarios where the recovery key is lost or unavailable.",
