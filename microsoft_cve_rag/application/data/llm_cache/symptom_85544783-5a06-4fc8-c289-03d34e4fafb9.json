  "description": "Users are experiencing issues with recovery partition sizing on a new installation of ESXi 7. The recovery partition is exceeding the recommended size of 512 MB, which can hinder the installation of updates that rely on the Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE). As outlined in KB-5028997, manual resizing of the partition may be required to accommodate necessary updates. Failure to address this could lead to complications during recovery boot processes or update installations, affecting overall system reliability. Therefore, it is crucial for system administrators managing VMs in ESXi environments to monitor recovery partition sizes closely to ensure compliance with operational requirements.",
