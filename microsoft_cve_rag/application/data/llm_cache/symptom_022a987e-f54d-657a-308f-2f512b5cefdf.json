  "description": "The system exhibits issues with the Windows 10 update process, where it continuously attempts to push the Windows 11 installation despite user preference to remain on Windows 10. Users have reported that after an interrupted upgrade to Windows 11, the system lacks the option to permanently stay on Windows 10, leading to repeated upgrade prompts. To mitigate this, a registry modification is employed to set a target version for Windows 10, effectively stopping the Windows 11 push and stabilizing the update process.",
