  "description": "Affected Microsoft Surface devices running specific versions of Windows may allow unauthorized applications to bypass Hypervisor-Protected Code Integrity (HVCI) protections. Users may experience unexpected behavior when executing applications, as these applications can manipulate kernel-mode pages erroneously marked as read, write, and execute even with HVCI enabled. This results in a significant loss of integrity for the affected system, as malicious actors can potentially modify critical system files. The impacted builds include Windows 10 Version 22H2, such as 10.0.19045.3930, and Windows 11 Version 21H2, like 10.0.22000.2713, as detailed in KB Article IDs KB5034121, KB5034122, and KB5034123. System administrators and end users should be vigilant for signs of alteration or corruption in system performance and security features.",
