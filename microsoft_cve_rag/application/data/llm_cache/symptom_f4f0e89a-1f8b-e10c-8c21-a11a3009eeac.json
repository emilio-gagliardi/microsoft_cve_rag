  "description": "After applying the security updates detailed in KB-5037788 and related articles, systems running various builds of Windows 10 and Windows 11 may experience unexpected reboots. This behavior could manifest across multiple build numbers, including 10.0.19045.4412 and 10.0.22631.3593. Users might notice that their system restarts without warning, disrupting workflows and potentially leading to data loss or corruption if unsaved work is present. The issue impacts both x64-based and 32-bit systems and is tied to the common log file system driver update associated with CVE-2024-29996. Administrators should monitor affected systems closely for this behavior, especially post-update.",
