  "description": "After applying the updates associated with KB5044285, KB5044284, KB5044280, and KB5044273 for affected Windows Server builds, users may encounter significant downtime due to denial of service (DoS) conditions triggered by the Internet Small Computer Systems Interface (iSCSI) subsystem. Systems with build numbers 10.0.22631.4317, 10.0.22621.4317, 10.0.26100.2033, and 10.0.22000.3260 may exhibit symptoms where iSCSI requests are not processed effectively. This results in the inability to establish or maintain connections over the iSCSI protocol, thereby completely denying access to shared storage resources. Administrators may observe that the services relying on iSCSI become unavailable or intermittent, leading to disruption in operations that rely on these connections. Prompt attention is necessary to mitigate the impact of these updates on affected environments to maintain system availability.",
