  "description": "The underlying cause of CVE-2024-21307 is rooted in a race condition present within the Remote Desktop Client software. When a user initiates a connection to a host, there exists a timing vulnerability that allows an attacker to exploit the condition before the proper session state is established. This enables unauthorized code execution due to the system's mishandling of the connection process, releasing certain controls prematurely. Specifically, the vulnerability extends to affected builds of the Remote Desktop Client for Windows, where timing issues allow an attacker to manipulate the network protocol in a way that bypasses authentication checks. The flaw affects systems running multiple versions of Windows, reinforcing the necessity of keeping software up-to-date with issued updates and patches to mitigate the risk associated with this condition.",
