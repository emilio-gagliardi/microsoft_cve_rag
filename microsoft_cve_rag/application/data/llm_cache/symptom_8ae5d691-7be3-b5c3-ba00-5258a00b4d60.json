  "description": "Users experience issues with Windows Secure Boot not verifying updates correctly following installation of the latest cumulative update. Despite setting the appropriate registry key to indicate available updates and executing the corresponding scheduled task, the expected verification against the Windows UEFI CA 2023 fails, returning 'false'. This behavior persists through multiple system reboots and manual checks with tools like regedit. As a workaround, system administrators have resorted to disabling Secure Boot entirely, which may expose the system to compatibility issues with certain hardware or security features. This scenario affects Windows systems using UEFI firmware and underscores potential concerns during the update process.",
