  "description": "Users of the Microsoft Edge browser based on Chromium version 128.0.2739.42 may experience instability and erratic behavior due to a type confusion vulnerability identified as CVE-2024-7971. This flaw allows a remote attacker to trigger heap corruption, which can manifest as crashes, unresponsiveness, or unexpected behaviors when navigating to malicious web pages. Administrators are advised to ensure that users update to the latest build to mitigate these symptoms, as earlier versions are susceptible to exploitation. End users might notice issues such as unexpected application closes or abnormal delays in loading web content, particularly when engaging with crafted HTML pages.",
