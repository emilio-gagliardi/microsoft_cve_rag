  "description": "After applying updates related to CVE-2024-38153, end users on affected systems may notice unauthorized access to system resources due to an elevation of privilege. This can result in unexpected changes to system configurations and files, as user commands may be executed with higher permissions than intended. Systems running Windows 10 versions 21H2 (10.0.19044.4780), 22H2 (10.0.19045.4780), and Windows 11 version 24H2 (10.0.26100.1457) are particularly impacted. Administrators may observe unfamiliar behavior where standard user actions lead to escalated privileges, causing a potential security breach. Users running on these builds should consult the relevant KB articles, such as KB5041571 and KB5041592, to understand the implications and mitigate associated risks.",
