  "description": "After the installation of the security updates detailed in KB-5036925, KB-5036894, KB-5036893, and KB-5036892 for Windows build versions 10.0.19045.4291, 10.0.19044.4291, 10.0.22631.3447, 10.0.22000.2899, 10.0.22621.3447, and 10.0.10240.20596, end users may experience observable failures in cryptographic functionalities. These could manifest as unexpected authentication errors in applications that rely on Windows Cryptographic Services, leading to potential disruptions in secure communication or data integrity checks. Applications may intermittently fail to verify signatures or exhibit delays in cryptographic operations, leading to reduced system trustworthiness. Users might also encounter failure messages when attempting to run certain secure applications, which could halt workflows reliant on cryptographic processes. This issue emphasizes the critical nature of maintaining up-to-date cryptographic services to ensure system stability and security compliance.",
