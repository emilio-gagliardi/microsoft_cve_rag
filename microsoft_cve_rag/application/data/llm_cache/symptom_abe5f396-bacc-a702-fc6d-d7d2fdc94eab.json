  "description": "Users of Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) version 126.0.2592.113 may experience instability when utilizing screen capture features due to underlying issues related to the Chromium engine. This can manifest as unexpected application crashes or freezes after performing specific UI gestures that interact with screen capture. In some instances, users might notice increased lag or delayed responses when attempting to engage with this functionality, causing a disruptive user experience. This behavior is a consequence of a use after free vulnerability, addressed in the security update KB-126.0.2592.113, highlighting the importance of updating to this version to mitigate these observable effects. Therefore, to ensure smooth operation of screen capture features, managing an adequate update schedule is vital for administrators overseeing enterprise environments.",
