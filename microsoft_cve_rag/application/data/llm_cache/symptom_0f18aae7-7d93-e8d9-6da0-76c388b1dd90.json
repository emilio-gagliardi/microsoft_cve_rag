  "description": "The symptom observed involves Intune halting the population of new driver updates, resulting in an inability for administrators to approve these updates for deployment. This issue arose around December when new drivers ceased appearing in Intune. In addition, during the upgrade testing from Windows 11 22H2 to Windows 11 23H2, devices were not receiving the feature updates as they typically would, which is disrupting the expected update flow. The investigation into the tenant's Graph revealed outdated policies that should not have been present, indicating a breakdown in communication between Intune and the Windows Update for Business deployment service. Despite repeated engagements with Microsoft support, they were unable to assess the health of the tenant's Graph, leaving the administrators in a challenging position with unresolved deployment policies. The limited visibility into driver and feature update status in Intune directly impacts the management of device updates within the organization.",
