The specific versions affected include Microsoft Edge version 119.0.2151.97 and earlier releases based on Chromium, as well as the related extended stable build 118.0.2088.122. This vulnerability was addressed in the stable release published on November 29, 2023, with corresponding updates provided through KB-119.0.2151.97.
