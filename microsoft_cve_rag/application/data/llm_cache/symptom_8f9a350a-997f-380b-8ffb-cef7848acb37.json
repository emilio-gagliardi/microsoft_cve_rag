  "description": "In Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) version 127.0.2651.74, users may experience instability when interacting with tabs, particularly if engaging in specific UI gestures. This instability can manifest as unresponsiveness or browser crashes that occur unexpectedly. The root cause is linked to a 'use after free' issue within the Chromium engine that underlies the Edge browser. Users may notice their sessions suddenly terminate or tabs fail to reload properly, affecting their overall browsing experience. For users on earlier versions, such as 127.0.6533.73, these symptoms are particularly salient until they upgrade to the secure version that mitigates this behavior, as documented in KB-127.0.2651.74.",
