  "description": "End users may notice unauthorized actions being executed on their system, as a local authenticated attacker could exploit the win32k driver vulnerability to gain elevated admin privileges. This can manifest in unexpected behavior such as the installation of unauthorized software, changes to system settings, or access to sensitive data that the user previously deemed secure. Affected systems include various builds of Windows 10 and Windows 11, specifically builds 10.0.19045.4412, 10.0.22631.3593, 10.0.22000.2960, and others as referenced in KB5037788, KB5037771, KB5037770, and KB5037768. System administrators are advised to monitor for any unusual activity on these systems and apply the relevant updates promptly to mitigate these risks.",
