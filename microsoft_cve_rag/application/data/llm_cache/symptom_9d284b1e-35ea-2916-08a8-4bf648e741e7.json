  "description": "End users operating on various Windows 10 and Windows 11 builds may observe potential security threats leading to remote code execution. Specifically, the Windows Mobile Broadband driver is implicated, affecting multiple build numbers such as 10.0.19045.4412 and 10.0.22631.3593, as outlined in KB articles KB5037771, KB5037770, and KB5037768. Users might notice unusual behavior on their systems, where unauthorized entities could gain control, leading to serious implications such as data breaches or unauthorized actions taken through their devices. Immediate attention is advised for systems running the impacted builds to mitigate risks, as these security vulnerabilities can be exploited without requiring user interaction, amplifying the urgency for updates.",
