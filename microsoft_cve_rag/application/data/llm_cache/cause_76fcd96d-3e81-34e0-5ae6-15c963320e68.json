  "description": "The underlying issue arises due to a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability associated with the CreateAttachmentFromURI functionality in OWA. This vulnerability allows an attacker, after authenticating to OWA, to create a draft message and invoke the createattachmentfromuri feature, triggering an SSRF attack. Consequently, the response received from the SSRF is improperly handled and attached to the email message, which the attacker can then download. Such SSRF vulnerabilities can lead to exposure of sensitive data or internal server responses, significantly compromising the integrity of the system. The specific vulnerability is documented in the Zero-Day Initiative advisory ZDI-CAN-22101, which outlines the attack sequence and implications clearly, necessitating immediate remediation for affected server configurations.",
