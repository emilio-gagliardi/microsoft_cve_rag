  "description": "After applying the security updates associated with CVE-2024-30092, users may observe that the Hyper-V host system experiences frequent denial of service (DoS) incidents. These incidents occur when a guest virtual machine (VM) manages to compromise the Hyper-V host's kernel, forcing it to read from an arbitrary address that could be invalid. Such actions can lead to a complete crash of the Hyper-V host, causing all running virtual machines to be unresponsive. System administrators may notice error messages regarding the Hyper-V service being abruptly terminated, or they may need to restart the host frequently. The affected builds include Windows 10, version 22000 (10.0.22000.3260) and Windows 11, version 24H2 (10.0.26100.2033), with relevant KB articles being KB-5044285, KB-5044284, and KB-5044280. This reliability issue calls for immediate attention to ensure system stability and service availability.",
