  "description": "Authenticated users experiencing issues with their SQL client applications may notice that they are misled into connecting to malicious SQL servers. This connection can result in unauthorized code execution within the context of their client. Affected builds include Windows 10 and Windows 11 with relevant KB Articles KB-5035858, KB-5035854, KB-5035853, and KB-5035845. Symptoms may manifest as unexpected application behavior or unanticipated prompts asking for sensitive credentials, as malicious payloads could be sent down the connection. This issue primarily affects users utilizing the SQL client under network conditions that expose them to potential attacker controls.",
