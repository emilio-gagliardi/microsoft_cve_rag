  "description": "Querying the Win32_Product class causes a reconfiguration of all MSI-based products, which can result in extensive changes and can significantly extend processing time. This behavior is acknowledged as an old known issue by Microsoft, although the exact point at which it started remains unclear. The issue stems from the way Windows Installer handles the querying of installed applications, effectively triggering a modification process for each one. As a result, administrators should be cautious while querying this class in environments with many installed products. The reference to this known issue can be found in Microsoft's documentation, which provides further details and appropriate resolutions.",
