  "description": "End users may encounter scenarios where they are prompted to open documents that have been compromised. The security update for Microsoft Office products, specifically impacting versions such as Office 2016, Office 2019, and Microsoft 365 Apps for Enterprise, addresses a vulnerability that could lead to remote code execution if a user interacts with a malicious file. Users experience an abnormal reliance on their action to open files, which may compromise the integrity of their systems. Subsequent to a security breach, the affected software builds include 16.0.5452.1000 and others related to various editions, necessitating users to be cautious of files they receive, as the straightforward act of opening these files could lead to potential code execution without their consent. This behavior emphasizes the importance of user awareness and vigilance regarding the documents they open after a security patch.",
