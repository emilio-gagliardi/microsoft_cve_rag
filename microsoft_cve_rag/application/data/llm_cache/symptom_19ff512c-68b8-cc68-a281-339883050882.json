  "description": "The Veeam Service Provider Console (VSPC) has an unsafe deserialization method that allows for remote code execution (RCE) under specific conditions. This vulnerability directly affects versions 7.0.0.18899 and 8.0.0.19236 of the VSPC. When the management agent communicates with its components, it potentially exposes the VSPC server machine to unauthorized access and control. Administrators must ensure they are using the fixed builds to mitigate the risks associated with this flaw. It is essential to monitor and apply the necessary updates as documented in relevant KB articles for ongoing security.",
