  "description": "End users may experience system instability and unexpected crashes after applying the security updates related to Windows Kernel Elevation of Privilege, as outlined in KB5044293. This issue particularly affects Windows 10 and Windows 11 systems with various build numbers including 10.0.22631.4317 and 10.0.26100.2033. Administrators have reported that these incidents occur intermittently following the installation of the patches, which indicates potential disruptions in system availability or performance. Consequently, users may notice a decrease in system responsiveness, random application terminations, and difficulties in maintaining stable sessions across their devices. It is crucial for IT departments to monitor system behavior closely after these updates to mitigate the impact on user productivity.",
