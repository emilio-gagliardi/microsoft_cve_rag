  "description": "Following the installation of updates for Windows 10 and Windows 11 systems, end users may notice significant performance issues, including unresponsiveness or application crashes, particularly in networked environments. This is a direct consequence of the active remote code execution vulnerability identified by CVE-2024-38063. Systems with builds such as Windows 10 Version 21H2 (10.0.19044.4780) and Windows 11 Version 24H2 (10.0.26100.1457) face risks that could lead to unauthorized access or control. Additionally, there may be intermittent disruptions in network services, notably when IPv6 is enabled, as exploit attempts can result in resource exhaustion, hampering connectivity and overall system stability. System administrators should monitor affected builds closely and ensure patches KB5043067 and others are applied promptly to mitigate these observable issues.",
