  "description": "The underlying cause of the issue described in CVE-2024-21337 is a local elevation of privilege vulnerability in Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) that occurs due to insufficient restrictions on certain operations performed within the browser. This vulnerability allows an attacker with local access (via keyboard or console) or through tricking a user (via social engineering) to execute arbitrary code. The affected product builds, specifically versions 120.0.2210.133 and 120.0.2336.0, do not correctly enforce security policies, leading to unauthorized manipulation of the system's privileges. Essentially, the issue stems from how the browser handles user interactions and the complexity involved in exploiting the flaw, which requires specific conditions to be met, such as user consent and local access to the device. This combination of factors creates a unique attack vector that can potentially allow for the compromise of system integrity, all while not necessitating any elevated privileges from the attacker prior to exploitation.",
