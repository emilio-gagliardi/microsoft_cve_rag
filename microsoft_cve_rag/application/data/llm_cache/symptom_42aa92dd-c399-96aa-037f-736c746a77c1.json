  "description": "When utilizing the custom WinPE .iso with endpoint management software, users may encounter issues that prevent successful booting on mitigated devices. This is particularly relevant for environments that are optimizing for Windows 11 (24h2) deployment. Despite using the Windows ADK with an updated WinPE image, the inability to get the endpoint management software to properly handle the updated .iso can hinder operational efficiency. The testing indicated that while the custom WinPE image booted without issues when created using the latest Windows ADK, the endpoint management software's version may not support the updates correctly. This discrepancy underlines the importance of compatibility with current build standards and software updates.",
