  "symptom_label": "third_party_antivirus_disables_defender_realtime_protection",
  "description": "On Windows 11 and earlier versions, the installation of third-party antivirus software leads to the disabling of Windows Defender's real-time protection feature. This presents a significant issue, as it reduces the overall security posture of the system by allowing potentially malicious software to operate without supervision. In contrast, on Windows Server 2016 and later, installing third-party antivirus does not automatically disable this feature, requiring manual uninstallation of the antivirus to ensure Defender's real-time protection is active. Administrators may need to navigate through various versions or SKUs to find the appropriate settings, complicating the troubleshooting process. It's essential that system administrators are aware of these differences to maintain effective malware protection across their environments.",
