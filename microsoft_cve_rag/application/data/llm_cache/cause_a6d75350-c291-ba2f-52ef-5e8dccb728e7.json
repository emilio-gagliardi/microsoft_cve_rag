  "description": "The cause of CVE-2024-30089 is a 'use after free' condition in the Microsoft streaming service that allows an attacker to exploit a local elevation of privilege. This vulnerability occurs when an application assigns a reference to a memory location that has already been freed, leading to unintended access to memory. Affected systems can be exploited by direct interaction or tricked user action, allowing the attacker to gain system privileges without needing user interaction.",
