  "description": "After installing updates KB5044617 and KB5044285 on Windows 11 Pro 23H2, the registry value for WinREVersion was observed to be missing from the intended path in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE registry. This issue could potentially lead to problems related to system recovery functionalities, particularly affecting how the Microsoft Windows Recovery Environment is utilized. Affected versions include Windows 11 21H2, 22H2, and 23H2. Users may not be able to access system recovery options effectively, as indicated by the results from PowerShell commands querying the recovery image data and location. It is crucial for system administrators to verify the registry keys post-update to ensure that the recovery environment is correctly configured.",
