  "description": "The underlying cause of the reported issue, identified as CVE-2023-36396, is a flaw in the Windows compressed folder implementation, which allows for remote code execution when a specially crafted document is opened. This vulnerability arises from the compartmentalization of read, write, and execute capabilities not being properly isolated, thereby enabling attackers to execute arbitrary code locally after convincing a user to interact with a malicious file. The affected build numbers include 10.0.22621.2715 for Windows 11 Version 22H2 and 10.0.22631.2715 for Windows 11 Version 23H2, both of which are detailed in KB5032190. Security measures need to be heightened to mitigate unauthorized local script executions that emerge from user interactions.",
