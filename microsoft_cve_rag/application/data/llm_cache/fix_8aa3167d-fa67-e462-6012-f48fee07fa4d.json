  "description": "**Fix Overview**:\n\nTo enhance security regarding cached logons, it is recommended to adjust Group Policy Object (GPO) settings:\n\n1. Access your Group Policy management console.\n2. Navigate to the setting for cached logons and verify the default value.\n3. Reduce the default number of cached logons from 10 to zero.\n\n**Details**:\n- Reducing the cached logon limit to zero aligns with security guidelines provided by Microsoft and NIST, effectively mitigating risks associated with user session hijacking.\n- It's important to understand that unlocking an account that is already logged on differs from logging in when no session is present, hence careful management of sessions is required.\n",
