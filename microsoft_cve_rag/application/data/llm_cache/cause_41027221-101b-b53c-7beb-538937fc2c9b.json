  "description": "The underlying cause of CVE-2023-36404 is a Windows kernel information disclosure vulnerability occurring in specific builds of Windows operating systems, notably Windows 10 and Windows 11. This vulnerability enables attackers to gain unauthorized access to values of registry keys that they do not have permissions to view. It arises from a flaw in how the Windows kernel processes local user interactions and access privileges, allowing an unauthorized user to exploit the kernel's local components. The affected build numbers include 10.0.22631.2715, 10.0.19043.3693, 10.0.22621.2715, and others as detailed in the release notes. The recommended mitigation is available through Microsoft security updates detailed in KB articles KB-5032192, KB-5032190, and KB-5032189.",
