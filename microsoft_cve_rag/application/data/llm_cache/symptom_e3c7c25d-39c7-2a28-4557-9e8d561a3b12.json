  "description": "After updating to Microsoft Edge version 126.0.2592.8, users may experience frequent crashes of the browser. This behavior is likely due to a use-after-free error related to SwiftShader in the underlying Chromium code, which has been addressed in subsequent security updates. Users may note the event of the browser becoming unresponsive followed by a complete shutdown, prompting the need to restart the application. Such crashes could hinder productivity, especially if users rely heavily on Edge for browsing or web-based applications. KB-126.0.2592.8 outlines this specific issue and the importance of updating to the latest version of Microsoft Edge to mitigate potential disruptions.",
