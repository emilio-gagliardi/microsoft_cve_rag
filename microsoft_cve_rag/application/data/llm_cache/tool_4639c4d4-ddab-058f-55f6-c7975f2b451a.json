  "description": "A Group Policy Object (GPO) modification used to enforce reboot prompts on user machines that are ignoring patch management notifications. The desktop support team altered certain GPO settings, ensuring that users are prompted to log off and initiate the reboot process in a timely manner. Implementing this tool helps maintain compliance with updates and ensures that critical security patches are applied effectively. This proactive measure minimizes potential vulnerabilities due to delayed reboots and helps streamline the patch management process. (LLM Synthesized)",
