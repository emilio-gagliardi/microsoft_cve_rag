  "description": "A remote code execution vulnerability in the shim boot support that involves trusting attacker-controlled values when parsing an HTTP response, allowing for a crafted malicious HTTP request to enable out-of-bounds write operations. This situation necessitates man-in-the-middle capabilities or a compromised boot server during the early boot phase for successful exploitation.",
