  "description": "After applying the updates referenced in KB5040442, KB5040431, and KB5040427, users may notice unexpected changes in system privileges. This can manifest as applications or processes running with elevated permissions without proper authorization, which could lead to potential unauthorized access to sensitive system resources. Administrators may observe that certain user actions are allowed that were previously restricted, raising concerns about the integrity and security of the system. These updates were rolled out for various Windows 10 and Windows 11 builds, including versions 22631.3880 and 22621.3880, addressing important elevation of privilege concerns. It's vital for administrators to monitor their environments for unusual activity following the installation of these updates to mitigate risks effectively.",
