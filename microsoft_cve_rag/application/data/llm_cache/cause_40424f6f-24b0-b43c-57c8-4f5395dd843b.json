  "description": "The underlying reason for the flagged vulnerability on patched Windows 2016 systems relates to CVE-2017-8563, which indicates that applying the cumulative update (CU) alone is insufficient to mitigate the risk associated with this vulnerability. Additional registry keys must be configured after the CU is applied to effectively eliminate the vulnerability and ensure that the systems are no longer flagged as vulnerable. Without implementing these specific registry changes, the server remains susceptible to risks described in KB-4034879. The lack of these registry keys on the affected Windows 2016 servers leads to a situation where security scans continue to report a vulnerability, despite the CU being installed. The issue emphasizes the importance of reviewing and applying all necessary configurations post-update to maintain system security.",
