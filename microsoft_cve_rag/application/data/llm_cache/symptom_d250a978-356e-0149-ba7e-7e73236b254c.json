  "description": "Recent updates to iOS 17.1.x and macOS 14.1.x have introduced code regressions that affect the functionality of the Microsoft Enterprise SSO Plug-in, leading to failures in Microsoft Entra ID Single Sign-On (SSO) for Microsoft 365 services. Users on these operating system versions may find themselves unable to successfully authenticate to applications that rely on browser SSO mechanisms. The absence of reliable fallback methods, particularly in environments utilizing third-party Mobile Device Management solutions, exacerbates this issue, causing significant disruptions in access to web portals and cloud services.",
