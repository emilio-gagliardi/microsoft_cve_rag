  "description": "**Fix Overview**:\n\nTo enable Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on new Windows 11 version 24H2 devices that do not have the required feature installed:\n\n1. Open an elevated Command Prompt (Run as Administrator).\n2. Use the following DISM command to install the Windows Sense Client:\n\n```bash\ndism /online /add-capability /capabilityname:microsoft.windows.sense.client\n```\n\nThis command installs the necessary endpoint protection feature that might have been omitted during the system setup, ensuring compliance with corporate resource access policies.\n\n**Details**:\n- Ensure the device is upgraded to Pro if you initially purchased a device with a Home SKU.\n- This fix is necessary when a device has not correctly enrolled in the Defender for Endpoint service, leading to a lack of protection and compliance errors.
