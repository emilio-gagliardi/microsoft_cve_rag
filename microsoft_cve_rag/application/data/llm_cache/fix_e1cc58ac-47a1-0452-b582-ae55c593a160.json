  "description": "**Fix Overview**:\n\nTo address the error messages (0x50 or 0x7e) encountered on systems running the CrowdStrike Falcon agent:\n\n1. Start your Windows system into safe mode or the Windows recovery environment.\n\n2. Navigate to the directory: `C:\\Windows\\System32\\Drivers\\CrowdStrike`.\n\n3. Locate the file matching `c-00000291*.sys` and delete it.\n\n4. Restart your device to apply the changes.\n\n5. Be aware that recovery of systems may require a BitLocker key in some cases.\n\nFor Windows virtual machines on Azure, refer to the mitigation steps in Azure status. Additionally, a new USB recovery tool is available to assist IT admins with the repair process.\n\n**Details**:\nThis process is essential for systems experiencing continuous restarts or blue screen errors due to recent updates from CrowdStrike on July 18, 2024. Ensure that you have access to necessary recovery information before proceeding. (LLM Synthesized)",
