  "description": "Authenticated attackers may bypass Windows Code Integrity policies, leading to significant loss of file integrity. This vulnerability affects various Windows builds, specifically including the versions for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Users may experience unauthorized modifications to critical files, allowing attackers to replace original file content with maliciously crafted content. Notifications of altered files or system instability may occur as a direct consequence, marking a serious issue for system administrators monitoring file integrity. For reference, this is documented under KB5034763 for Windows 10 Version 22H2 and related updates for other builds as well.",
