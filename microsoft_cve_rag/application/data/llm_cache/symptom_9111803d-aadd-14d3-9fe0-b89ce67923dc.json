  "description": "Users may experience unexpected disclosure of sensitive information when interacting with remote sessions managed by the Windows Remote Access Connection Manager. This observable behavior can manifest as inadvertent exposure of data, which can occur when specific build numbers of Windows systems are in use, particularly those identified as 10.0.19045.4291, 10.0.19044.4291, 10.0.22631.3447, 10.0.22000.2899, and 10.0.22621.3447. The issue has been documented under the KB article references KB-5036894, KB-5036893, and KB-5036892. System administrators should be aware that the presence of this vulnerability could lead to compromised data integrity and necessitate immediate updates or patches to mitigate risks associated with this disclosure.",
