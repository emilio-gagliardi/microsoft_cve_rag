  "description": "The underlying cause relates to the insufficient size of the recovery partitions on several thousand computers running Windows. This issue stems from a lack of automation in managing partition sizes which Microsoft has acknowledged by referring users to a script rather than implementing a native solution. Users have reported that integrating MHimken's Patch-WinRE script with Intune has significantly improved their ability to manage these partitions. The reliance on a manual script indicates a gap in the out-of-the-box functionality and highlights a need for better automated tools in handling system recovery processes. As a result of this cause, IT departments are forced to implement custom solutions to address these partition size issues effectively.",
