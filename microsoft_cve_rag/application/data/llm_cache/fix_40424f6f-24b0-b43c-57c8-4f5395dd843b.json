  "description": "**Fix Overview**:\n\nTo ensure that your Windows Server 2016 systems are no longer flagged as vulnerable due to CVE-2017-8563, follow these steps:\n\n1. Ensure that the appropriate cumulative update (CU) has been installed on your Windows 2016 servers.\n\n2. After installing the CU, verify whether additional registry keys are required. These keys are essential for removing the vulnerability flag as the CU alone isn't sufficient.\n\n3. Refer to the Microsoft Knowledge Base article KB-4034879 for detailed instructions on the specific registry changes that need to be applied: \n   - Registry entry for LDAP authentication over SSL/TLS.\n\n4. Check whether the required registry keys are present on the affected servers. This can usually be done using PowerShell or the Registry Editor.\n\n5. If the necessary keys are not present, proceed to create them based on the guidelines provided in the KB article.\n\n**Details**:\n- It's crucial to investigate any vulnerabilities reported by your security scanner, as some may be due to missing registry configurations rather than absent updates. (LLM Synthesized)\n\n**Preconditions**:\n- Ensure administrative privileges are available to modify registry settings.\n- Backup the registry before making changes to prevent unintended issues.",
