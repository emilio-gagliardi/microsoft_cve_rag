  "description": "After applying the latest security update (KB49023) for Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) version 130.0.2849.46, users may observe an increased risk of remote code execution if they navigate to potentially malicious websites. This behavior indicates that the browser could be exploited by an attacker who tricks the user into visiting a crafted webpage, leading to unauthorized access to confidential information. System administrators should inform users about the necessity of cautious browsing habits and the importance of deploying the updated version promptly to mitigate this risk. Although there is no immediate degradation of performance, the possibility of exploitation remains a concern due to the underlying vulnerability associated with the use after free flaw (CWE-416).",
