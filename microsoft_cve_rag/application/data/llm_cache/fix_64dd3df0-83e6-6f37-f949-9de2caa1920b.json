  "description": "**Fix Overview**:\n\nTo address potential issues with Chrome 131 related to the use of Post-Quantum Key Agreement, follow the steps below to adjust the Chrome configuration.\n\n1. Set the software policy for Google Chrome to disable Post-Quantum Key Agreement by applying the following policy:\n\n```plaintext\nsoftware\\policies\\google\\chrome\\postquantumkeyagreementenabled = 0\n```\n\n2. Restart Chrome for the changes to take effect.\n\n**Details**:\nThis workaround is necessary as enabling Post-Quantum Key Agreement may conflict with certain TLS middleboxes, leading to operational issues. Disabling this setting helps maintain a stable connection through these middleboxes. Ensure you verify the compatibility of the configurations with your organization\u2019s policies before implementation.",
