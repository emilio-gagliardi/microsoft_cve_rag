  "description": "Implement Action1 patch management tool for automatic updates and vulnerability scanning. This approach allows administrators to configure a policy for daily checks for software updates, which can be set to require user approval or run automatically. Action1 also features an integrated vulnerability scanner that alerts users to CVE notifications, providing suggestions on remediation actions. The focus is on efficiency, reducing the manual workload of managing updates and vulnerabilities over time. By streamlining these processes, system administrators can ensure their environments remain current without extensive manual oversight.",
