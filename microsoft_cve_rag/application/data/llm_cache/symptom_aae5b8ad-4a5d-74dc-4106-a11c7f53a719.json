  "description": "Hosting Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) and DNS on a domain controller can expose the system to security risks. Running unnecessary software on a DC increases the attack surface, making it susceptible to exploits. If DHCP is installed on the DC, there is a potential for unauthorized access if a service account with insufficient delegated permissions is used. It is recommended to migrate the DHCP service to a separate server or a layer-3 device to enhance security and reduce the operational hassle. This precaution is crucial to maintaining the integrity and stability of the domain controller environment.",
