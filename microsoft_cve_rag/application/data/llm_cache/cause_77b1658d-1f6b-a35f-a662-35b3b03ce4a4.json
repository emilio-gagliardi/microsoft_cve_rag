  "description": "The root cause of CVE-2024-20652 is a security feature bypass vulnerability within the Windows HTML platform. The issue arises when the 'mapurltozone' method, which is responsible for properly determining the security zone of a URL, incorrectly returns a zone value of 'intranet' for URLs containing device paths that are redirected using the LAN Manager (Lanman) redirector device object. This misbehavior enables an attacker to exploit the system by manipulating these URLs to bypass intended security mechanisms and gain access to restricted resources. The vulnerability impacts various Windows 10 and Windows 11 builds, including versions 10.0.19044.3930, 10.0.19045.3930, 10.0.22000.2713, and 10.0.22631.3007, making it crucial for system administrators to apply the relevant KB updates (KB-5034134, KB-5034123, etc.) to mitigate potential exploitation. As it stands, the vulnerability can be exploited remotely without requiring user interaction, elevating the risk across affected systems.",
