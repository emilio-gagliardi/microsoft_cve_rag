  "description": "After installing the security update for Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) version 126.0.2592.56, users may experience system instability, leading to unexpected crashes of the browser. This symptom can manifest as abrupt termination of the browser during typical usage scenarios, especially when opening certain web pages or executing specific scripts. Users may also notice frequent error messages indicating that 'Microsoft Edge has stopped working,' disrupting their browsing experience. The issue is particularly relevant for organizations relying on Edge for critical web applications, which may impede productivity until resolved. Update KB-126.0.2592.56 should be reviewed by system administrators to ensure compatibility and mitigate this behavior post-update.",
