  "description": "Users may experience a significant risk of remote code execution when connecting to malicious SQL databases through their SQL client applications. The security issue can lead to unauthorized execution of arbitrary code, potentially affecting the integrity and confidentiality of user data. This observable behavior results from the underlying vulnerability (CVE-2024-21372) found in Windows OLE for various build numbers, including 10.0.19045.4046 and earlier versions listed in KB5034763. As a consequence, administrators may find that users are inadvertently exposing their systems to attack, requiring immediate attention to mitigate potential impacts on system security and data integrity.",
