  "description": "The Remote Desktop Gateway service experiences a failure in responsiveness, leading to disconnections for clients relying on this service. This issue occurs specifically when the service is engaged in Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) over HTTP. The failure can significantly disrupt operations, especially for users who depend on remote access. The release notes refer to improvements addressed in the context of KB article KB-5044284, which builds upon fixes from KB-5043178 released earlier. Organizations using this service should ensure they are up to date with the latest patches to avoid this critical interruption.",
