  "description": "**Tool Overview**:\n\nThe `dism` command is a powerful utility that is part of the Windows operating system. It stands for Deployment Image Servicing and Management, and it is primarily used for servicing Windows images, both online and offline. Specifically, the `/online` parameter allows you to apply changes to the currently running operating system. The `/cleanup-image` argument is used to perform maintenance tasks on the image, while `/restorehealth` scans the image for corruption and attempts to repair it. This makes it an essential tool for troubleshooting and repairing Windows installations, particularly useful when encountering installation errors or system corruption.\n\n**Usage Example**:\n```powershell\n# Command to use DISM to restore health of the Windows image\nDism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth\n```  \nThis command needs to be run in an elevated command prompt for it to work correctly. It's advisable to follow it up with a `sfc /scannow` command to ensure complete system integrity after repairs have been made.\n\n***Details***\n\n1. The tool can be executed from the Command Prompt or via Windows PowerShell.\n2. Make sure to run it as an Administrator.\n3. Useful for tackling errors when Windows updates fail.\n4. It is a part of system maintenance routines to keep Windows healthy.\n5. Can be combined with other commands for comprehensive system diagnostics and repairs.",
