  "description": "After the deployment of KB5036979, the affected Windows machines exhibit a bluescreen error on reboot, leading them into the Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE). Users are unable to access Safe Mode, complicating recovery efforts, as the installation appears misconfigured and inaccessible. Crash dump logs are not generated, preventing an analysis of the failure. Attempts to uninstall the problematic update yield errors, further reinforcing the severity of the situation faced by system administrators managing a fleet of 20+ devices. This results in a significant operational disruption, causing updates to be halted until a resolution is established.",
