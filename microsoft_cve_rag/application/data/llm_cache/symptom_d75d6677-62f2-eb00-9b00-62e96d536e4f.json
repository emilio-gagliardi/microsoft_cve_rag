  "description": "Users may experience installation issues when attempting to perform an automatic upgrade of Windows 10 using a mounted ISO file. The process might fail if the drive letter is not correctly set during the setup process. Specifically, if the command to mount the ISO does not assign a drive letter appropriately, running the setup executable can result in failure to initiate the upgrade. This could affect various build versions of Windows 10, particularly those related to KB-5041580. Administrators need to ensure that the ISO is properly mounted and that a valid drive letter is assigned before starting the upgrade to avoid setup issues.",
