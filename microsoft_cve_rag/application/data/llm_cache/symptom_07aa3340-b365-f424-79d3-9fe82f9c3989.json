  "description": "There are complications related to the Secure Boot certificate expiration that will occur in 2026, impacting Windows systems that utilize Secure Boot technology. The update process requires managing the available updates registry key, specifically needing it set to 0x30, which is necessary for applying mitigations outlined in KB5025885. This KB article is important as it not only addresses updates to the secure boot database revocation (dbx) but also the integrity policy file located on the EFI partition. Administrators may face difficulties if the system or firmware requires updates in a specific order or if manual interventions are necessary, leading to inconsistent system states. Furthermore, as different hardware OEMs may have varying implementations of BIOS, this complexity might create additional challenges for ensuring uniform updates across an enterprise environment.",
