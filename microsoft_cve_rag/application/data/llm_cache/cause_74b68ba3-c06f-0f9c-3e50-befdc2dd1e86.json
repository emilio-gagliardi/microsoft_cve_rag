  "description": "The cause of the compatibility problem with previous RCT files stems from the fix implemented for the Windows RCT performance issue. This suggests a scenario where the resolution for enhancing RCT performance inadvertently affects the functionality of existing RCT files. Such a situation typically indicates a regression that was not accounted for during the testing phase of the update rollout. As a result, systems that utilize older RCT files may encounter issues post-installation of the October 2023 cumulative update. It is crucial for system administrators to verify compatibility of their existing RCT files with the new update to avoid operational hindrances.",
