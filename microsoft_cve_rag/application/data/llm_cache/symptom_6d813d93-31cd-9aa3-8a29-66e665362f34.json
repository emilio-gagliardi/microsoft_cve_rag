  "symptom_label": "standard_user_cannot_delete_workstation_account",
  "description": "A standard user in a domain environment experiences an inability to delete computer workstation accounts and join new computers using the same name as previously deleted ones. The user is required to submit support tickets for every removal of a workstation from the domain, leading to inefficiencies and potential delays. Despite extensive efforts to configure the necessary settings and policies to enable this functionality, no successful resolution was achieved. This issue continues to persist across multiple attempts, indicating a gap in user permissions or policy application. This situation affects the overall productivity of standard users who rely on workstation management capabilities within the networked environment.",
