  "description": "Users of Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) version 126.0.2592.56 may encounter unexpected behavior when downloading files, specifically a compromised file could obfuscate the security user interface. This can lead to confusion as the browser may not immediately alert the user to potential risks associated with the downloaded content. The security impact arises from inappropriate handling during the download process, which could undermine user trust in the browser. Affected users may notice visual discrepancies in the security interface or undefined actions leading them to download potentially harmful files, which subsequently may pose a risk to their environment. The issue is associated with KB-126.0.2592.56, which addresses this vulnerability and prompts users to ensure they are on the latest build to avoid these symptoms.",
