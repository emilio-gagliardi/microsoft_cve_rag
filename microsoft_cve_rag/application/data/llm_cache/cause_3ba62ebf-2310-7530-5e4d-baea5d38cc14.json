  "description": "The vulnerability stems from improper link resolution before file access in the Windows Container Manager Service, allowing an attacker to exploit this flaw leading to unmanaged elevation of privileges in affected environments. High attack complexity and no user interaction are required for successful exploitation, meaning an attacker could potentially manipulate file access mechanisms due to inadequate path validation.",
