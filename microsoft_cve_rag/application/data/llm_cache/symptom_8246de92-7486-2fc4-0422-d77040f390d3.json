  "description": "Users may experience an abnormality in the display when using Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) version 127.0.2651.74. Specifically, issues can arise during fullscreen interactions resulting in misalignments of the screen's contents. This misalignment could prevent users from properly interacting with the interface, as elements might be positioned incorrectly or obscured, leading to confusion or frustration. The problem is tied to a specific implementation flaw addressed in CVE-2024-6995, which impacts the user experience, especially while consuming content that relies on full interface display modes. This situation highlights the importance of maintaining up-to-date software to ensure optimal performance and usability.",
