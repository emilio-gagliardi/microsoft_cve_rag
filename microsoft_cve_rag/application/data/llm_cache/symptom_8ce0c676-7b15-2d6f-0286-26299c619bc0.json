  "description": "When using the Microsoft ODBC driver in build numbers 10.0.19044.3930, 10.0.19045.3930, 10.0.22000.2713, and 10.0.22631.3007, users may experience unexpected errors indicating that their SQL client application is vulnerable to remote code execution. This occurs due to an attacker successfully persuading an authenticated user to connect to a malicious SQL database. As a result, this can manifest as failure to execute certain operations or the application behaving unpredictably. Users may notice unusual prompts or error messages when attempting to interact with their SQL clients, especially in environments impacted by KB-5034134, KB-5034123, KB-5034122, and KB-5034121. This situation can lead to significant disruptions in workflow as legitimate database operations may be hindered by the errors introduced through this vulnerability.",
