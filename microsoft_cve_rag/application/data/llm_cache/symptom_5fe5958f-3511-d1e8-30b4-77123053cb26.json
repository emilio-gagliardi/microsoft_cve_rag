  "description": "After installing the security updates (KB5043080, KB5043076, KB5043067) on Windows 11 versions 21H2, 22H2, 23H2, and 24H2, users may experience an increase in the risk of unauthorized actions being executed on their systems. This can manifest as unexpected system privileges being granted, resulting in abnormal application behavior or unauthorized access to sensitive resources. Affected users or administrators may notice changes in access control, where regular accounts may gain excess permissions or where the system's integrity could be compromised, leading to potential security risks. The build numbers impacted include 10.0.26100.1742 for 24H2, and 10.0.22631.4169, 10.0.22621.4169, and 10.0.22000.3197 for previous versions, highlighting the problem across multiple releases. The severity of this issue is classified as important, indicating that it should be addressed promptly to prevent potential exploitation.",
