  "description": "After installing the Windows 11 update KB5041585 released on July 9, 2024, users may encounter a BitLocker recovery screen upon startup. This behavior is particularly prevalent on devices where device encryption is enabled. The issue arises for both Windows 11 23H2 and 22H2 environments. Retaining access to the boot process can become problematic, leading to user frustration and potential downtime. Currently, Microsoft acknowledges this as a known issue and is actively working on a resolution.",
