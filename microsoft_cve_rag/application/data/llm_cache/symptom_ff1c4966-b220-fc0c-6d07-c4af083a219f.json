  "description": "When enabling Windows 11 on laptops, users may experience significantly decreased VPN performance, manifesting as a connection that 'slows to a crawl.' This issue indicates a potential misconfiguration or the need to enable 'Routing and Remote Access' to ensure optimal VPN functionality. Administrators should investigate if this service is disabled, as its proper function is key to maintaining effective remote access performance on Windows 11 devices. Monitoring network throughput and responsiveness during VPN sessions can help identify if this configuration is the cause of performance degradation. Keeping clear documentation about service statuses after integrating new operating systems like Windows 11 is critical for troubleshooting such issues.",
