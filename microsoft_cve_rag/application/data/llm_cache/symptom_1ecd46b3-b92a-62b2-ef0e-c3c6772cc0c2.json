  "description": "Some workstations are experiencing system issues where the recovery partition is either missing or not properly configured. This is particularly evident after the application of the January 2024 cumulative update, which is failing on affected servers. The lack of a correctly sized recovery partition can hinder system recovery processes, affecting the ability to restore the OS, which can complicate maintenance and repair operations. The actions required include recreating the recovery partition or resizing the existing partitions to accommodate recovery functionality effectively.",
