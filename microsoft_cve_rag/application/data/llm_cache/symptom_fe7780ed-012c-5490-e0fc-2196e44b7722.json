  "description": "Home users are encountering serious issues due to recent updates that lack a graphical user interface (GUI) method for certain operations. This complication arises particularly with third-party applications like Minitool Partition Wizard and AOMEI Partition Assistant, which might lead to difficulties in managing disk partitions or performing necessary operations post-update. As a result, users are likely to face frustrating limitations and potential data management issues as a direct consequence of the update.",
