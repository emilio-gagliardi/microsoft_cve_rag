  "description": "Following an upgrade to Windows 10 version 24h2, clients are experiencing activation issues. The issue manifests as an inaccurate display of license status; despite using Multiple Activation Key (MAK) licenses, the system shows that the clients are still licensed. This problem may hinder the proper functionality of Windows, leading to potential disruption in access to updates and support services. As this behavior affects the activation process, IT administrators may need to investigate further to ensure compliance with licensing agreements and to rectify the misreporting of activation status. Administrators should check for available updates or patches that may address this issue and ensure proper license management practices are adhered to.",
