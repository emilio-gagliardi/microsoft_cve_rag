  "description": "Users may experience an inability to access certain administrative functions or elevated permissions following the installation of updates related to KB-5037788, KB-5037771, KB-5037770, and KB-5037768 on affected Windows builds. Specifically, this can affect systems running Windows 10 and 11 within build numbers [10, 0, 19045, 4412], [10, 0, 22631, 3593], and others. As a result, administrative tasks such as installation of software or system configurations may fail, leading to increased user frustration. Additionally, this may manifest as unexpected prompts for credentials due to restrictions in access levels, impacting productivity. System administrators should be vigilant for reports of these issues to ensure smooth operational continuity.",
