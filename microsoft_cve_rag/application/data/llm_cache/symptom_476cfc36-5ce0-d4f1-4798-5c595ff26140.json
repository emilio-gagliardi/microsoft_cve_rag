  "description": "After applying the security patch associated with KB-120.0.2210.61 for Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based), users may experience issues where the browser does not automatically update to the latest version. This means that users could remain on an outdated version, potentially missing out on important security fixes and features introduced in later updates. The expected build number following the update should be 120.0.2210.61, released on December 7, 2023, yet some users might find themselves operating with an earlier build.",
