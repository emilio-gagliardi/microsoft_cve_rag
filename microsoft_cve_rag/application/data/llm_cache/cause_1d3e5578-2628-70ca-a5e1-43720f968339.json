  "description": "The core cause relates to the rollout of the new Teams client by Microsoft, which was associated with instances of the Teams application disappearing from user devices. This issue seems to stem from conflicts arising during the simultaneous deployment of the new client and the version being deployed to Windows 10 machines. Furthermore, potential complications were exacerbated by the Microsoft Store for Business being nearly non-functional, alongside organizational policies blocking access to the public Microsoft Store. These elements combined create a complex environment that contributed to instability and operational inconsistency of the new Teams client.",
