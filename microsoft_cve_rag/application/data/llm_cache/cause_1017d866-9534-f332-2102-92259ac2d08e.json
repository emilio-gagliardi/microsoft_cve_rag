  "description": "The cause of potential legal issues arises from the improper understanding and management of Oracle's licensing requirements for Java Runtime Environment (JRE). Users who download Oracle products without having secured the necessary licenses may face significant legal ramifications, as Oracle actively tracks the IP addresses of downloaders. This oversight is particularly pertinent for many organizations needing JRE 8, typically 32-bit, as unlicensed downloads can lead to severe consequences. Additionally, to mitigate this risk, the recommendation is to use Amazon Corretto as a compliant alternative for JRE 8 installations. The urgency in addressing this cause highlights the importance of adhering to software licensing agreements to avoid unanticipated legal complications.",
