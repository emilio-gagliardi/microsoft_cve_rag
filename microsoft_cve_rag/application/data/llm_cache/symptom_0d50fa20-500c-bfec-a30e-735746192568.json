  "description": "After the deployment of the March Exchange SU, users running Exchange 2019 in cached mode may experience failures when utilizing the search functionality. Testing indicates that this issue may also be present in online mode, which operates differently from cached mode. A case has been opened with Microsoft, confirming that the root cause lies within the March update. Users trying to perform searches might notice discrepancies or an inability to retrieve expected email results, affecting their workflow. This behavior can lead to significant disruptions in daily operations for organizations relying on email search capabilities for Exchange 2019.",
