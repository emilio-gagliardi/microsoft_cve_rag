  "description": "After applying the security updates associated with KB-5036925, KB-5036894, KB-5036893, and KB-5036892 on Windows 10 build versions 19045.4291, 19044.4291, 22631.3447, 22000.2899, 22621.3447, and 10240.20596, users may experience stability issues. Specific symptoms include random application crashes, and in some cases, the operating system may become unresponsive during certain tasks. The patch aims to address a secure boot security feature bypass, hence the lingering instability might make users feel anxious about the overall reliability of the system. Notably, system administrators should monitor for any reports of degraded performance and unintended behavior after applying these patches. This response urges users to exercise caution and ensure backups are available before updating.",
