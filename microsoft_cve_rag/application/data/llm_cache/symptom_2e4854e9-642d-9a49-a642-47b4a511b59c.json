  "description": "The Windows kernel-mode driver may inadvertently disclose sensitive information, leading to high confidentiality loss for affected systems. Users may notice unexpected exposure of private memory layout information, which could facilitate unauthorized access to critical data. This issue affects multiple Windows versions, including Windows 11 (specifically versions 24H2, 23H2, and 22H2) and various Windows 10 editions (22H2, 21H2, and earlier). The disclosed information allows potential attackers to better predict the memory addressing, increasing risks on systems with versions referenced in KB articles like KB5044285 and KB5044284, among others. Administrators and end-users alike should remain vigilant for any signs of unauthorized data exposure or abnormal behavior in memory management following updates.",
