  "description": "The underlying cause of CVE-2024-43557 is due to improper input validation within the Windows Mobile Broadband Driver. The specific condition leading to this denial of service vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read that may exploit the drivers' integration with the network stack, allowing attacker access from a logically adjacent network, such as those sharing the same physical connection over Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. This flaw exists in certain build numbers of Windows 10 and Windows 11 and is characterized by low attack complexity and the absence of required privileges or user interaction for exploitation.",
