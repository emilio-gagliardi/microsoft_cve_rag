  "description": "The root cause of the elevation of privilege issue described in CVE-2023-36407 lies in improper access controls within the Hyper-V component of Windows operating systems. The vulnerability stems from the vulnerable handling of read, write, and execute permissions that allow an attacker with low privileges to escalate their system privileges. This can occur locally through direct system access or remotely via protocols like SSH, especially if the attacker can trick a valid user into executing malicious documents. The issue affects multiple build numbers, specifically 10.0.25398.531, 10.0.22621.2715, and 10.0.22000.2600, as indicated in KB articles KB-5032202, KB-5032190, and KB-5032192. The flaw permits significant risks, including loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the impacted component, highlighting the urgency for remediation via the official patches provided.",
