  "description": "After applying the updates associated with KB-5036925, KB-5036894, KB-5036893, and KB-5036892, users on Windows 10 builds including 19045.4291, 19044.4291, 22631.3447, 22000.2899, 22621.3447, and 10240.20596 may experience issues related to the secure boot feature. Specifically, the secure boot functionality may not operate as intended, which could potentially allow for unauthorized changes to the system firmware, leading to persistent security concerns for affected systems. This behavior is noticeable as the secure boot process may fail or exhibit unexpected results during system startup, causing confusion among users and requiring additional troubleshooting steps. Administrators may also observe error logs that indicate issues with secure boot verification, complicating their environment's risk management efforts. This impact is particularly important to monitor for organizations reliant on secure boot to protect against advanced persistent threats.",
