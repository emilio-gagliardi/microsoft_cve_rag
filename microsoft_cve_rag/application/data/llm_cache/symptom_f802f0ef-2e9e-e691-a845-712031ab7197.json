  "description": "Users may experience crashes or freezes when utilizing specific user interface gestures in Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) version 130.0.2849.46. This issue is a consequence of the underlying use-after-free vulnerability in the UI component, as documented in CVE-2024-9957. Administrators should encourage users to avoid specific UI interactions until they can upgrade to the patched version (130.0.6723.59) that addresses this vulnerability. Users navigating to crafted HTML pages may encounter instability, leading to unresponsiveness of the browser, resulting in potential loss of productivity. End users running affected versions need to ensure that they update their browser promptly to mitigate these observed behaviors and to maintain system stability.",
