  "description": "The underlying cause of the boot issue with the thumb drive is the reliance on installed mitigations, which are necessary for successful booting from the media. Without these mitigations installed on a device, the system is programmed not to allow the updated thumb drive to be used for booting, leading to operational challenges. This reflects an incompatibility in the boot process post-mitigation installation, necessitating different thumb drives for devices before and after mitigations. Thus, the lack of the required mitigations triggers a failure in the boot process, indicating a deeper issue with how the bootloader interacts with system configurations that have undergone recent changes. The commands applied to update the thumb drive highlight a specific lifecycle dependency introduced by these mitigations in the Windows PE environment.",
