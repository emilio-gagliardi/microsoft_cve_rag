  "description": "After applying the security patch identified in KB-5036893, users may observe that applications utilizing Libarchive experience unexpected behaviors, particularly concerning remote operations. End users may interact with malicious documents or executables which can lead to unintended command execution due to the remote code execution flaw. This can compromise the confidentiality and integrity of information on affected systems running Windows 10 builds 22631.3447 and 22621.3447. It's important to note that successful exploitation requires user interaction, as an unauthorized attacker must wait for a user to perform specific actions to trigger the exploit. Consequently, organizations should remain vigilant for any unusual application behavior, specifically when opening or processing archived files, as users may inadvertently expose their systems to risks.",
