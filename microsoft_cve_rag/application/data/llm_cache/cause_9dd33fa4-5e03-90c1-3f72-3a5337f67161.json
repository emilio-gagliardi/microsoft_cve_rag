  "description": "The core technical condition responsible for the information disclosure linked to CVE-2024-20664 stems from a flaw within the Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ) subsystem. This subsystem, which enables message communication between applications, has a specific vulnerability that allows an attacker to access and read small portions of heap memory. This issue is primarily situated within the network stack where the MSMQ component is exposed to network-based interactions, making it potentially exploitable by attackers over the internet. The flaw can be exploited without any user interaction, reinforcing the severity of the information disclosure risk. To mitigate the risk, Microsoft has released multiple security updates spanning different Windows operating systems, ensuring that affected versions are patched to eliminate accessibility to the vulnerable memory segments.",
