  "description": "The underlying cause of the performance issues experienced by users of the Outlook client is related to caching problems, which lead to increased consumption of system resources. This malfunction causes the application to freeze or crash, impacting all connection methods, including both the Outlook desktop client and Outlook on the web. Affected users are required to take specific actions to alleviate the issue. For desktop users, it is recommended to restart the Outlook client or app, and this action may need to be performed twice due to persistent cache problems. Additionally, users of Outlook on the web should refresh their sessions and, if necessary, clear their browser cache to resolve the performance disruptions. Although the issues have been addressed by updates, users must actively apply these changes for effective remediation.",
