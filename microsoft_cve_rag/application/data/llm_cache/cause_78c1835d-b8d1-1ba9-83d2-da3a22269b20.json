  "description": "The cause of the installation failure for updates is often linked to issues within the Windows services responsible for update management. Specifically, if the Windows Update Service (wuauserv) and Background Intelligent Transfer Service (bits) are not functioning correctly or are blocked, it can prevent proper update installations. Renaming the software distribution folder can resolve issues caused by corrupted files during previous update attempts. Additionally, clearing temporary files through the %temp% directory can remove remnants that might interfere with new installations. This approach is particularly effective in environments where multiple updates are handled simultaneously, leading to potential conflicts.",
