  "description": "Server 2016 is not displaying the update KB5033373 in the Windows Update Catalog, which results in a situation where administrators must manually download and apply patches to their servers. This behavior disrupts the normal automated update process, causing potential delays in patch management and increasing the risk of vulnerabilities if updates are not consistently applied. The inability to find the update in a critical management tool can hinder organizational compliance and system security.",
