  "description": "End users and system administrators may experience unauthorized access to sensitive information, as the Windows Remote Access Connection Manager displays vulnerabilities in certain builds. For instance, users on Windows 11 Version 23H2 (10.0.22631.3880) and Windows 10 Version 22H2 (10.0.19045.4651) may notice that small portions of heap memory can potentially be read by an attacker. This behavior indicates that the security settings of their operating systems have flaws leading to unintended data exposure. Administrators should consult Knowledge Base Articles KB5040442, KB5040427, and KB5040431 to mitigate the issue, as it affects multiple Windows product builds including various versions of Windows Server and Windows 10. The importance of patch management becomes evident as these symptoms directly impact the confidentiality and integrity of data stored within the affected systems.",
