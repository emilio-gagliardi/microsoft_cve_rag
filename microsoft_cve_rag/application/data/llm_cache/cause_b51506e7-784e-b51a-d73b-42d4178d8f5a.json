  "description": "The cause of the issue described is related to the configurations needed to handle secure boot changes stemming from vulnerabilities identified as CVE-2023-24932 and CVE-2024-28921. Specifically, the patching process requires setting specific registry values which are prone to needing multiple reboots (noted as '2x reboot') to take effect. The complexity of these mitigations results in significant complications for system administrators, particularly when using SCCM/Config Manager. It highlights a difficulty in managing Windows boot manager revocations without a more scriptable or automated solution. Additionally, the associated KB Article KB5025885 provides further instructions on managing these changes effectively, yet emphasizes a need for improvement in the patching process for these particular vulnerabilities.",
