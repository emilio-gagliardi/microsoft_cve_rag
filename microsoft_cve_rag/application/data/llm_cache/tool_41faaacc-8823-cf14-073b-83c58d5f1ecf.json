  "description": "**Tool Overview**:\nThis Azure Automation script is designed to check if all devices have their BIOS up to date and export the BIOS status to a CSV file stored on SharePoint. \n\n**Details**:\n1. The script queries all devices connected to the enterprise environment to verify their BIOS versions.\n2. If a device's BIOS is not up to date, a notification is sent via TAMS (Team Automation Management System).\n3. The BIOS status information for each device is compiled into a CSV format.\n4. The CSV file is then exported to a designated SharePoint location for easy access and reporting.\n5. This tool integrates seamlessly with Azure Automation, allowing for scheduled checks and automated reporting.\n",
