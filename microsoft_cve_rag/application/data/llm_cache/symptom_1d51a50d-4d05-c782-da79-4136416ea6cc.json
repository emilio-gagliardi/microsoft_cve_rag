  "description": "An indication of incomplete SQL Server updates may arise when organizations lack proper implementation of instance-based updates. Without adopting Azure Update Manager via Arc, on-premises SQL Server environments fail to utilize the advantages afforded by Software Assurance licenses. This ultimately leads to inefficiencies in the patch management process and the potential for unpatched vulnerabilities within SQL Server instances. Users may observe outdated SQL Server instances that do not receive the necessary updates to maintain functionality and compliance. The absence of KB articles may further compound the difficulty in ensuring all SQL components receive appropriate updates in a timely manner, thereby impacting overall system performance.",
