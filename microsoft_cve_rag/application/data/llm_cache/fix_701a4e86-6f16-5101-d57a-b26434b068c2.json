  "description": "The updates KB-5031419 and KB-5031407 provide necessary modifications to the sppsvc component located in 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\spp\\tokens\\rules'. These updates are crucial for enabling the ESU MAK add-on if existing ESU keys do not support the installation of ESU updates for the upcoming month. Administrators should ensure that these updates are applied to maintain compliance and functionality concerning Extended Security Updates. Given that these are part of the monthly rollup for October 2023, it is recommended to prioritize their deployment to affected servers running relevant Windows versions. The updates address potential barriers to receiving future ESU updates and keep systems in good standing.",
