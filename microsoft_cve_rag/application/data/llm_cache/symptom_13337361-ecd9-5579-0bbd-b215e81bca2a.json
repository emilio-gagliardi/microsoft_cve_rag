  "description": "Administrators may encounter issues with BitLocker when attempting to reboot a device. If the recovery key is not readily accessible, users face the risk of being locked out, causing significant operational distress. It is crucial to be aware that in standalone settings, the absence of the recovery key could lead to a situation where the system prevents booting, impacting productivity. The recovery key is typically associated with the original user's Entra ID or Microsoft account, which may become inaccessible during troubleshooting. In such cases, a full device reinstallation might be necessary if the reboot process fails and recovery cannot be initiated.",
