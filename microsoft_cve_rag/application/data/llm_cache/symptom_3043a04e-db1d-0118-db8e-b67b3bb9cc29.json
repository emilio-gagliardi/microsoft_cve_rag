This can lead to unexpected access to sensitive areas within the Windows environment, as evidenced by logs showing escalated permissions without a legitimate cause. Affected builds include 10.0.19045.4291, 10.0.19044.4291, 10.0.22631.3447, 10.0.22000.2899, and 10.0.22621.3447. System administrators should monitor for any discrepancies in user account permissions following these updates to prevent unauthorized access and maintain system integrity.",
