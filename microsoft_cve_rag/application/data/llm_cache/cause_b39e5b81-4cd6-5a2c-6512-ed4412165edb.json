  "description": "The underlying cause here relates to the changes enforced by the KB-5020276 update, which introduces specific hardening changes to domain joining processes. These changes require the proper configuration of Group Policy settings to enable trusted users to manage computer objects. If not appropriately configured, users may face restrictions that prevent them from re-using computer objects unless they initially created them. The critical aspect is ensuring that an Active Directory group is created and appropriately listed in the applicable Group Policy setting relevant to the Domain Controllers GPO. This setup allows users with necessary rights to join computers to Active Directory without running into permissions issues.",
