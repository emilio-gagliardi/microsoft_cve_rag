  "description": "After the installation of the security update addressing CVE-2024-38032, users may experience unexpected behavior on their systems, particularly Windows 10 and Windows 11 devices. Specifically, upon clicking specially crafted URLs, there is a potential risk of remote code execution. This could manifest as unauthorized access to the system, where the attacker is able to execute arbitrary code. Such behavior represents a significant operational risk, potentially resulting in system instability or the compromise of user data. It is crucial for system administrators to monitor affected builds such as 10.0.19045.4651, 10.0.22621.3880, and others identified in KB articles KB5040442 and KB5040431, to ensure that employees are not inadvertently exposed to this vulnerability.",
