  "description": "System administrators and users may observe that the Microsoft Edge browser, particularly in versions 119.0.2151.58 and extended stable 118.0.2088.102, exhibits unexpected behavior that allows for elevation of privileges when users open specially crafted files. This observable behavior can stem from user actions where they inadvertently click on malicious links or attachments. The associated update to address this issue can be found in KB-119.0.2151.58, which underscores the need for end-user caution to mitigate potential impacts on confidentiality and integrity.",
