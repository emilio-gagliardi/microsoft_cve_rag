  "description": "Users of Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) version 130.0.2849.56 may notice issues with certain Chrome extensions, as the inappropriate implementation in extensions allows remote attackers to bypass site isolation. This could manifest as unexpected behaviors when using these extensions, including failure to load or execute as intended, leading to disruptions in user workflows. End users may see error messages related to extension functionality or experience degraded performance when utilizing affected extensions. It's crucial for users to upgrade to Microsoft Edge version 130.0.6723.69 or later to mitigate these issues and ensure proper extension compatibility.",
