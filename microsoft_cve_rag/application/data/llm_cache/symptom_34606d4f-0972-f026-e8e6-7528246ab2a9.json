  "description": "Virtual machines (VMs) that are installed without a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) present face significant upgrade and update issues. System administrators have observed that such VMs are unable to receive any updates or upgrades, rendering them potentially obsolete and vulnerable. There is an implication that a registry setting may be configured to allow a non-saving upgrade, but it does not negate the primary issue. The context suggests a reliance on TPM for successful management of system updates, particularly in environments utilizing Windows 10 or later builds. This behavior can hinder operational efficiency and expose the systems to risks of running outdated software.",
