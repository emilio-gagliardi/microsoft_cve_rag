  "description": "Users of Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) version 126.0.2592.56 may encounter issues resulting from a use-after-free vulnerability in the browser's UI. This could lead to unexpected behavior while browsing, such as graphical glitches or potential crashes when engaging with certain user interface elements that a malicious actor could exploit. The browser could exhibit slow response times or unresponsiveness during specific interactions that rely on the vulnerable UI, causing users to experience frustration and potentially loss of productivity. It is crucial for users to ensure they update to the latest version, which mitigates this risk, as documented in KB-126.0.2592.56.",
