  "description": "Users may experience failures while attempting to install Windows updates due to issues with the update-related services. Specifically, the services associated with updates such as Windows Update (wuauserv) and Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) may need to be manually stopped and restarted. Additionally, a common troubleshooting step involves renaming the software distribution folder and clearing temporary files, which are not always automatically handled by the system, potentially leading to installation errors.",
