  "description": "**Fix Overview**:\n\nTo onboard a device for a new user using Intune:\n\n1. Perform an Autopilot wipe on the device to reset it to a factory state.\n2. Assign the device to the new user after the wipe.\n3. Ensure you have sequenced your standard experience in Intune so that all required applications will be automatically installed following the reset.\n4. Alternatively, if you prefer not to wipe, you can reassign the device to another user directly in the Intune portal, streamlining the process and retaining the current user settings.\n\n**Details**:\n- Sequencing the standard experience simplifies the reinstalling of necessary applications and configurations.\n- Reassigning directly in the Intune portal can save time if the device does not require a full reset.
