  "description": "The technical cause of the issue identified as CVE-2024-0519 is an out-of-bounds memory access vulnerability present in the V8 JavaScript engine of the Chromium open-source software. This vulnerability enables unauthorized access to memory locations, potentially leading to information disclosure or arbitrary code execution within the Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) browser. Chromium, which is the foundation of Microsoft Edge, manifests this flaw in versions preceding the deployment of the fix. The vulnerability was reported alongside an acknowledgment from Google indicating its existence in the wild. To mitigate this issue, users of the Microsoft Edge browser must ensure they are using version 120.0.2210.144 or later, which incorporates the necessary updates to remedy the out-of-bounds memory access issue.",
