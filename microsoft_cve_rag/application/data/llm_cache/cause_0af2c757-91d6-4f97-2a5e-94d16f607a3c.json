  "description": "The underlying issue causing the inability to boot the Surface Pro is related to the BitLocker encryption process, particularly the loss or unavailability of the BitLocker recovery key. Users may encounter this problem when they fail to back up their recovery key or when the associated Microsoft account is inaccessible. If the BitLocker recovery key is saved under a Microsoft account that the user can no longer access, it results in a situation where recovery is not possible without reinstalling Windows. This scenario is especially common among users who have not synchronized their data with cloud services or local backups. As a consequence, any data stored only on the BitLocker-encrypted drive may be permanently lost unless the recovery key can be retrieved from the Microsoft account. Relevant documentation regarding the retrieval of the BitLocker recovery key can be found in the support article linked in the post.",
