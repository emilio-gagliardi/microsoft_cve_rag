  "description": "**Fix Overview**:\n\nTo resolve issues related to SCCM failing to add update sources, follow these steps:\n\n1. Delete or rename the `registry.pol` file located in `C:\\Windows\\System32\\GroupPolicy\\Machine`.\n2. Clear the local group policy cache by deleting all contents within the group policy folder.\n3. If corruption is suspected in the data store folder, consider reinstalling the SCCM or MCM client.\n4. Ensure all enablement package updates for the OS are applied to address various issues.\n5. Run DISM and SFC scans to repair corrupt files, followed by system reboots as necessary.\n6. Verify there are no conflicting registry or policy settings between systems, especially those inherited from older SCCM versions.\n7. Ensure Intune deadlines are configured and devices are forced to reboot periodically to avoid issues.\n\n**Preconditions**:\n- Ensure administrative privileges are available to perform these actions.\n- Backup configuration settings before making changes to group policy or system files.",
