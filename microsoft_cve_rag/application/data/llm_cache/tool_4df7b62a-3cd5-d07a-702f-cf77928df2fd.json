  "description": "**Tool Overview**:\n\nThis tool refers to the process of installing a certificate obtained from a public certificate authority like DigiCert on domain controllers for establishing secure LDAP connections.\n\n**Details**:\n1. Acquire a wildcard certificate from a trusted public certificate authority, such as DigiCert, ensuring it covers all fully qualified domain names (FQDN) of your domain controllers.\n2. Install the certificate on the domain controllers to enable secure access. This installation is crucial for setting up LDAPS (LDAP over SSL).\n3. If using a load balancer, integrate the domain controllers into the load balancer setup to provide redundancy for secure connections.\n4. Optionally, consider DNS round robin configurations, although they may not offer the same reliability as a load balancer.\n5. Ensure post-installation that the certificate installed is configured correctly to enable secure communications effectively.",
