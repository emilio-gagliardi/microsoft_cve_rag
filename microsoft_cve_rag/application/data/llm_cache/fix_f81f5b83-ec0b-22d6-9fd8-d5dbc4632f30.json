  "description": "**Fix Overview**:\n\nWhen encountering issues with Windows 10 upgrades potentially due to hardware compatibility, it's advised to take the following steps:\n\n1. Ensure that VMware Tools is up to date by checking for any last updates.\n\n2. Run a compatibility scan using the upgrade setup executable with the following command:\n   ```\n   setup.exe /auto upgrade /quiet /noreboot /dynamicupdate disable /compat scanonly\n   ```\n\nThis command initiates a compatibility scan that helps identify any hardware or software conflicts that may hinder the upgrade process.\n\n**Details**:\n- This approach focuses on issues related to the recovery environment space and its sufficient allocation compared to the OS volume space.\n- Review recent updates that may affect system compatibility and ensure ample space is available in both environments for a successful upgrade.\n",
