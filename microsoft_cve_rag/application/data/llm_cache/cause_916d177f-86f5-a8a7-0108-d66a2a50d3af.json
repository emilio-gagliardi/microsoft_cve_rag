  "description": "A double free vulnerability in the Microsoft Speech API (SAPI) allows attackers to exploit memory management flaws, potentially leading to remote code execution when a targeted user interacts with a malicious input. This issue arises from incorrect handling of memory deallocation, allowing the same memory block to be freed twice. This condition is exploitable over the network, requiring user interaction to perform the action that triggers the vulnerability.",
