  "description": "The cause of the vulnerability in the kernel streaming service driver is attributed to improper input validation (CWE-20). This flaw allows an attacker to execute local access to the system, potentially leading to elevation of privileges. The issue manifests when the driver does not adequately validate input data, enabling various forms of exploitation through unsanctioned access and response handling in the kernel level.",
