  "description": "Users may experience crashes or unintended behavior in Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) version 126.0.2592.113 after installing potentially malicious extensions due to a use-after-free vulnerability addressed in CVE-2024-6777. This symptom can manifest as the browser becoming unresponsive, failing to load web pages, or closing unexpectedly. Users may find that normal browsing sessions are disrupted, impeding productivity and potentially causing data loss. This issue primarily affects Microsoft Edge, which utilizes the underlying Chromium framework, indicating that the problem pertains to the integrated features that rely on this open-source codebase. The recent security update mitigates these behaviors by reducing the risk associated with compromised extensions.",
