  "description": "The underlying cause of the issue discussed is the installation of an outdated Windows 10 build, specifically version 1511 from 2015. This outdated version lacks support for newer features and updates, which can lead to compatibility problems when attempting to upgrade. To resolve this, users should install the latest feature update, currently version 22H2, which is recommended to enhance system performance and security. The suggested upgrade can be performed either through Windows Update directly or by using the Windows Update Assistant available on Microsoft's website. This approach is essential to ensure the system is up-to-date and benefits from the latest patches and improvements provided by Microsoft.",
