  "description": "The underlying cause described in the post revolves around the design decision to exclude new roll-ups or service packs for Office 2016, which compels organizations to transition to Microsoft 365 and Click-to-Run technologies. This design change signifies a shift in Microsoft's support landscape, as Office 2016 no longer receives standard update mechanisms that organizations heavily rely on for maintaining system integrity. Consequently, managing updates for Office 2016 becomes a labor-intensive process involving manual efforts to compile and apply updates from 2015 onward. The reliance on tools like osdupdate and PowerShell to automate this process indicates a workaround to mitigate the lack of regular updates. This situation challenges administrators, especially in environments that have newly imaged devices, requiring careful packaging of patches and updates to ensure compliance and functionality upon deployment.",
