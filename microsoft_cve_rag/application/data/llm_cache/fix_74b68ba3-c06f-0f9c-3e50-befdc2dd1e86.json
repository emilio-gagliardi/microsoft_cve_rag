  "description": "To address the compatibility problem arising from the installation of the October 2023 cumulative update, ensure that all Windows RCT files are reviewed and updated accordingly. This may involve checking previous RCT files for compatibility with the new update. If issues persist after modification, consider reverting to earlier stable configurations or liaising with technical support for tailored interventions based on the specific environmental setup. Increased performance of VMs can be achieved by applying necessary adjustments in the Azure environment settings. For detailed steps, reference the discussion linked in the post.",
