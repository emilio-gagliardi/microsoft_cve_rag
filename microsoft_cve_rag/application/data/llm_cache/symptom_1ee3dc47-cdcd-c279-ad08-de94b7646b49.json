  "description": "Following the application of security update KB-5046633 and KB-5046613, users may observe that system operations are impaired due to elevation of privilege vulnerabilities. Systems running Windows 10 and Windows 11, particularly the specified builds, may experience instability where unauthorized users gain elevated rights, potentially resulting in unexpected software behaviors or configurations being altered. This situation can lead to unusual application crashes, diminished performance, or inconsistencies in administrative functions and access controls, necessitating immediate attention from system administrators. Windows versions affected include 10 (builds 19044.5131 and 19045.5131) and 11 (builds 22631.4460 and 22621.4460), highlighting the critical nature of monitoring system behavior post-update.",
