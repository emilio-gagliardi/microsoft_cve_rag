  "description": "**Tool Overview**:\n\nThis tool refers to a specific registry value application process that is utilized to manage Secure Boot configurations in Windows environments.\n\n**Details**:\n\nThe registry value application process involves applying specific registry values to the system to ensure proper Secure Boot functionality. In this context, the registry value `0x40` was applied post-installation of the 2024-02 cumulative update (CU). This is crucial for maintaining system security, as it aids in updating the Secure Boot Dbx (database of trust) and Windows boot manager revocation policy. The process typically requires administrative privileges and should be done with caution to ensure that the correct values are applied to avoid system boot issues.",
