  "description": "The root cause of the RCT issue, which affects the ability to start virtual machines, was identified as being linked to the installation of the cumulative update (CU) from October 2023. Users reported that after applying this update, virtual machines failed to start properly, leading to significant disruptions in service. The problem has been acknowledged and subsequently addressed in the November patch release. It's important to note that while the update history reflected this issue, it was not prominently listed, which may have caused confusion among users trying to troubleshoot the problem. For more details, see the discussion on Microsoft Tech Community regarding this fix.",
