  "description": "End users of Microsoft Edge version 128.0.2739.42 may observe that their browser fails to properly validate UI elements due to a flaw in the Chromium framework which can lead to UI spoofing. This inappropriate implementation affects how elements are rendered, increasing the risk of malicious actors presenting a deceptive interface that could mislead users. Such behavior undermines user trust and could potentially expose sensitive information, as users may unknowingly interact with fraudulent web pages. The build version 128.0.2739.42 includes security updates which rectify this issue, ensuring that the browser no longer facilitates such inaccurate representations of user interfaces. Users are encouraged to update their browsers to this version to mitigate these risks.",
