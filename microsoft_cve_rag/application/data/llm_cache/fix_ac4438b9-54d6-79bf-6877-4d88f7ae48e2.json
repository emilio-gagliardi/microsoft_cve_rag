  "description": "**Fix Overview**:\n\nDefragmentation of SSDs or NVMe drives is not recommended due to the potential to cause more problems than it solves, including negatively impacting the lifespan of the drive.\n\n**Details**:\nDefragmenting SSDs can lead to unnecessary wear on the components, as these drives are designed to manage data efficiently without the need for defragmentation. As such, it's better to avoid this practice to maintain optimal performance and extend the life of the SSD. Instead, ensure that system optimizations for SSDs are enabled, such as TRIM and proper storage utilization.\n\n(LLM Synthesized)\n\n**Preconditions**:\n- Make sure system settings for SSD performance are configured correctly.\n",
