  "description": "This Tool refers to the utilization of task sequences in the context of deploying new machines. Task sequences allow for the automated execution of a series of steps that can install software, configure settings, and manage recovery partition sizes effectively. In this case, the use of task sequences is aimed at ensuring that the recovery partition sizes for machines are appropriately adjusted and managed during the deployment process. The use of task sequences promotes a streamlined approach to patch management and system deployment, leading to higher success rates in pilot testing and overall system readiness for updates. It is particularly beneficial during the patching process, where manual intervention is minimized, allowing for faster and more reliable updates.",
