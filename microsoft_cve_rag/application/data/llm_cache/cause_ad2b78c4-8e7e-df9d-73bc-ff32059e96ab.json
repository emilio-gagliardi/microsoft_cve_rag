  "description": "The underlying cause of the installation failure for the January 2024 Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE) update is related to insufficient partition size in the recovery environment. Specifically, devices attempting to install the update may encounter the error '0x80070643 - error_install_failure' due to the Recovery Environment's partition being too small. In order to successfully complete the installation, it is essential to have at least 250 megabytes of free space available in the recovery partition. Guidance for manually resizing the WinRE partition can be found in KB5028997, which provides steps to rectify the partition size issue. This misconfiguration is a significant factor for affected platforms running various versions of Windows 10, including version 21H2 and 22H2, as stated in KB5034441.",
