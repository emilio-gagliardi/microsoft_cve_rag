  "description": "The issue arises from an out-of-bounds read vulnerability in Adobe software utilized by Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based). This flaw allows attackers to potentially disclose sensitive memory information, bypassing mitigations like Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR). Exploitation requires user interaction, as a victim must open a malicious file, which triggers the vulnerability to leak memory contents.",
