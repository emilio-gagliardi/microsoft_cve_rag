  "description": "The inability to successfully create a bootable WinPE ISO on mitigated devices that have Secure Boot enabled is a significant operational concern. This issue is particularly relevant for environments using Windows UEFI, where specific configurations (specifically the addition of Windows UEFI 2011 CA to the Secure Boot forbidden list) limit compatibility with certain boot methods. Administrators are reporting difficulties when adhering to the prescribed method outlined in Microsoft's documentation. This failure to boot using the generated ISO could hinder recovery efforts and system maintenance on devices enforcing Secure Boot policies. Thus, it is critical for system administrators to investigate and implement potential workarounds or review Microsoft resources for maintaining alignment with Secure Boot specifications.",
