  "description": "The underlying cause for issues related to Microsoft Secure Boot may stem from an outdated UEFI firmware version. This situation arises when the firmware does not meet the prerequisites outlined in Microsoft's documentation, specifically the requirement to have the most recent version available from the firmware vendor or OEM. Having an obsolete firmware version can impede the proper functioning of Secure Boot keys, potentially leading to security and operational complications within the Windows environment. Administrators are encouraged to confirm their UEFI firmware's current state to ensure alignment with the necessary conditions for updates and patches.",
