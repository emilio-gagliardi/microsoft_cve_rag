  "description": "The cause of this issue is a type confusion vulnerability that exists within the V8 JavaScript engine used in the Chromium open-source project. This vulnerability arises from improperly handled data types within the engine, which can lead to potential exploitation by an attacker to manipulate memory and execute arbitrary code. The specific build of Microsoft Edge affected by this issue prior to the fix was version 120.0.2210.144. When the Chromium framework is integrated into Microsoft Edge, any vulnerabilities present in Chromium directly impact Edge until addressed. The release date of the fix coincides with the security updates published on January 17, 2024, ensuring that users of Microsoft Edge are no longer vulnerable once they update to the latest version that includes the patch for this CVE.",
