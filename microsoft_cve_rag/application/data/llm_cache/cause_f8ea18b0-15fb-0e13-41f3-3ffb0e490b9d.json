  "description": "The cause of the issue identified in CVE-2023-6350 is an out-of-bounds memory access vulnerability in the libavif library used within the Chromium-based Microsoft Edge browser. This technical flaw can lead to improper handling of memory, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service. The issue is linked to the Chromium version updates, specifically affecting builds 119.0.2151.97 and lower. Mitigating this vulnerability necessitated updates that addressed the underlying memory management flaws in the Chromium open-source software that Microsoft Edge relies on, as documented in KB-119.0.2151.97. The resolution is critical for maintaining the integrity and security of Microsoft Edge for users relying on affected versions.",
