  "description": "The underlying issue is a heap-based buffer overflow in the Windows TCP/IP stack, which allows remote code execution through specially crafted network requests. Successful exploitation requires an understanding of the environment and specific configurations, such as the NetNat service being enabled, which is not the default setting. The flaw is present in multiple Windows builds, affecting systems without user interaction needed for the attack.",
