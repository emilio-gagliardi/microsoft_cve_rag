  "description": "After applying the updates associated with KB-5036925, KB-5036894, KB-5036893, and KB-5036892 on Windows 10 builds 19045.4291, 19044.4291, 22631.3447, 22000.2899, and 22621.3447, users may experience repeated system restarts. This behavior can significantly disrupt productivity, as users find that their machines fail to remain stable for extended periods. System administrators can observe that some devices return to the login screen unexpectedly even after successful login attempts. Users often report receiving sporadic error messages suggesting that the system needs to restart to apply configuration changes or updates. This symptom could potentially be linked to an issue with the secured boot process due to the bypass vulnerability outlined in the recent CVE releases.",
