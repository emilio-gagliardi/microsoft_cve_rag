  "description": "Installation of Microsoft Teams may fail if the necessary group policy settings have not been enabled prior to the installation. This issue is tied to the 365 ADMX templates that define the configuration for Teams. The failure to pre-enable this setting can lead to an inability for the application to start correctly or could result in a partial installation where essential features are inaccessible. System administrators should ensure that these group policy configurations are in place before deployment to avoid disruptions in service. Proper implementation of these settings ensures a smoother user experience and reduces the chances of installation-related issues.",
