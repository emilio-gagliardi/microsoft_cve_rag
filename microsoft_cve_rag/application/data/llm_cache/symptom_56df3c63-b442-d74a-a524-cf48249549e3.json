  "description": "Users may experience unauthorized access to systems configured with Secure Boot due to the identified vulnerabilities in build numbers 10.0.19045.4291, 10.0.19044.4291, 10.0.22631.3447, 10.0.22000.2899, 10.0.22621.3447, and 10.0.10240.20596. This may lead to security concerns, where users can potentially run untrusted code, undermining the integrity of the system. Administrators might notice that even after installing patches referenced in KB-5036925, KB-5036894, KB-5036893, and KB-5036892, the expected protections under Secure Boot are not fully effective. Users could report suspected compromises or irregular system behavior, indicating that the Secure Boot mechanism may not have been enforced correctly, resulting in unauthorized software running on what should be a secured environment. This could lead to increased risks and vulnerabilities if not resolved promptly.",
