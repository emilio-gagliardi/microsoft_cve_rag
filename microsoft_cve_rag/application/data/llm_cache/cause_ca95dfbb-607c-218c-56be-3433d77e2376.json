  "description": "The cause of CVE-2023-36402 lies in a vulnerability within the Microsoft WDAC OLE DB Provider for SQL Server, which is susceptible to remote code execution. This issue arises when an authenticated user is manipulated into connecting to a malicious SQL server. The server can send specially crafted replies that exploit the vulnerability, allowing code execution in the context of the user's SQL client application. The vulnerability is associated with multiple Windows build versions, including 10.0.22631.2715, 10.0.19043.3693, and others, as detailed in the referenced KB articles: KB-5032199, KB-5032192, KB-5032190, KB-5032189. The requirement of user interaction to establish the initial connection ultimately sets the stage for exploitation through malicious networking packets.",
