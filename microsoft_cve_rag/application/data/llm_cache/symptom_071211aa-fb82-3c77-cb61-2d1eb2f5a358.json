  "description": "After applying the Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) security update, users may need to manually verify their browser version to ensure they are using the latest and secure build, 120.0.2210.144. This can lead to confusion and interruptions in users' workflow, as they are required to navigate through browser settings to check for updates. Without this action, users may experience concerns about their browser's vulnerability status. Additionally, failure to update may result in inconsistent browsing experiences and the potential exposure to security threats that the latest update aims to resolve. The update aims to address the underlying Chromium vulnerabilities while facilitating a smoother and more secure browsing experience once the user has ensured their browser is current.",
