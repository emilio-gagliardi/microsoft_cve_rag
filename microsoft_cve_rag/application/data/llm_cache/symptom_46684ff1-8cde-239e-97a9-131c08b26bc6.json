  "description": "Users may experience issues where devices are vulnerable to secure boot bypass after installing relevant updates on versions 10.0.19045.4291, 10.0.19044.4291, 10.0.22631.3447, 10.0.22000.2899, 10.0.22621.3447, and 10.0.10240.20596. As a result, systems might not enforce the expected security features that protect against unauthorized code execution during the boot process. This could lead to a loss of integrity for the operating system, allowing potentially malicious software to load before the OS starts. The absence of proper protections could manifest as unexpected behaviors or altered access permissions across applications, raising security concerns among system administrators. Users should refer to KB-5036925, KB-5036894, KB-5036893, and KB-5036892 for documentation regarding the updates related to this issue.",
