  "description": "After the installation of updates associated with KB-5037788, KB-5037771, KB-5037770, and KB-5037768, systems running Windows Server 2012 and later build numbers may allow for unusual behavior in the Windows Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS). This is particularly notable on builds [10, 0, 19045, 4412], [10, 0, 22631, 3593], [10, 0, 22621, 3593], [10, 0, 22000, 2960], and [10, 0, 10240, 20651]. Users may observe unexpected errors involving remote code executions, potentially impacting connectivity and operational capabilities. Such failures can manifest as denied access to network services, disrupted client connections, or even service crashes, which users will notice as a significant disruption to their workflows.",
