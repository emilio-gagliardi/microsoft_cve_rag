  "description": "The core cause of CVE-2023-36425 is an out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the Microsoft Windows Distributed File System (DFS). This flaw enables an attacker to exploit heap corruption through a non-default DFS namespace configuration. Specifically, an attacker with delegate management permissions on a DFS namespace can manipulate settings to allow privileged access, leading to arbitrary code execution on the dfssvc.exe process, which operates with system-level privileges. Successful exploitation requires a specific misconfiguration involving both domain user rights and delegate permissions, making it a high complexity scenario. The affected build numbers include [10, 0, 22631, 2715], [10, 0, 19043, 3693], [10, 0, 10240, 20308], [10, 0, 22621, 2715], [10, 0, 19045, 3693], and [10, 0, 22000, 2600], with relevant KB articles being KB-5032199, KB-5032192, KB-5032190, and KB-5032189.",
