  "description": "The issue is that trusted users may not be able to reuse computer objects in Active Directory if they lack the appropriate rights. This can arise due to changes in group policy settings, specifically in the Domain Controllers Group Policy Object (GPO). Users must be added to an AD group that is specified in the applicable group policy setting, as outlined in KB5020276. Without the necessary rights to join computers to AD, even users who are trusted may face limitations in performing their tasks. This issue is specifically related to the hardening changes implemented for domain joins as described in the Microsoft support KB article.",
