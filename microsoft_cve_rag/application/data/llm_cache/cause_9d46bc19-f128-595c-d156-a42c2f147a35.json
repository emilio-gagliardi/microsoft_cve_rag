  "description": "The underlying cause inferred from the post relates to the requirement for users to reboot their systems after installing the updated SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) version 20.1. This update incorporates the latest driver versions for msodbcsql (MSI 17.10.6.1) and msoledbsql (MSI 18.7.2). It is suggested that having older versions of these drivers installed may lead to conflicts that necessitate a system reboot. Users are advised to review the release notes for the Microsoft ODBC and OLE DB drivers for more detailed information regarding these updates, which are believed to also include recently released security fixes. Thus, the combination of driver updates and legacy drivers is the critical factor causing the reboot requirement.",
