  "symptom_label": "vpn_and_patch_solutions_have_separate_codebases",
  "description": "The symptom indicates a lack of integration between the VPN and patch management solutions offered by Ivanti. Specifically, the VPN technology originated from Pulse, while the patch management technology is based on the Shavlik brand. This segregation suggests potential challenges in managing security updates across the different technologies, which can lead to vulnerabilities if patches for either system are not applied consistently and timely. Additionally, users may experience difficulties in coordinating updates if they are unaware of this separation. This situation could impact system reliability and security postures if both systems do not communicate effectively.",
