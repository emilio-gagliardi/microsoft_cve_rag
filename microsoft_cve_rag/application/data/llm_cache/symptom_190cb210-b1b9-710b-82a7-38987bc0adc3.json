  "description": "Microsoft Windows Server 2022 experiences an issue where it fails to stage an execution package associated with the PowerShell Integrated Scripting Environment (ISE). This defect is indicated by the error HRESULT 0x8007000d, which denotes 'ERROR_INVALID_DATA.' Such failures not only prevent the installation of updates but can also affect overall system performance and capabilities. Affected build number is 10.0.20348.1. The problem appears to mirror similar errors seen in Windows 10 and Windows 11 environments. However, the issue can be resolved using the DISM command with a mounted install.wim image, allowing for normal operation and successful patch installations.",
