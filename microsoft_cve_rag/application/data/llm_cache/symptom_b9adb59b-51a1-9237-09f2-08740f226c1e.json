  "description": "After applying the security update specified in KB-5034763, users may observe that the Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ) service intermittently experiences disruptions. This can manifest as delayed message delivery, resulting in communication failures between systems relying on MSMQ. Additionally, users may face unexpected errors when attempting to send or receive messages, leading to operational inefficiencies. The affected systems include various builds of Windows 10 and Windows 11, particularly from build numbers 10.0.19045.4046, 10.0.22000.2777, and 10.0.22631.3155. As the service may intermittently become unavailable, users could encounter significant interruptions in processes that depend on message queuing functionality, thereby impacting overall productivity.",
