  "description": "**Fix Overview**:\n\nTo facilitate the automated upgrade of Windows 11 using a series of commands, you can utilize a highly customized script in conjunction with a pre-staged ISO file hosted on a publicly controlled site.\n\n1. Prestage an ISO on a publicly accessible site that you can manage.\n\n2. On each machine, run the following process:\n   - Download the ISO using PowerShell with the command:\n   ```powershell\n   Invoke-RestMethod -Uri '<URL_of_ISO>' -OutFile 'Path_to_save_ISO'\n   ```\n   - Mount the ISO with:\n   ```powershell\n   Mount-DiskImage -ImagePath 'Path_to_ISO'\n   ```\n   - Execute `setup.exe` with the necessary command-line options. Refer to [Microsoft\u2019s documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/windows-setup-command-line-options) for the correct switches to use based on your needs.\n\n**Details**:\nUsing this approach allows for a streamlined update process across multiple machines. If issues arise with the upgrade, investigate alternative installation tools such as the `Windows11InstallationAssistant.exe`, which may simplify the installation process. (LLM Synthesized)\n\n**Preconditions**:\nEnsure you have administrative privileges on the machines.\nBackup important data before initiating the upgrade process to prevent any loss during the installation.",
