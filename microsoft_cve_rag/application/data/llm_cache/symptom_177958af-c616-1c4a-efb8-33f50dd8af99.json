  "description": "After installing the security update for Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) version 128.0.2739.42, users may experience crashes when attempting to access or autofill saved passwords. This behavior manifests as sudden application terminations while interacting with the password manager within Edge. Affected users might notice that their browsers fail to respond or become unresponsive specifically during these interactions, disrupting their ability to log into services efficiently. This issue could lead to frustrations as users are unable to retrieve or input their credentials seamlessly. Additional contextual information can be found in the corresponding KB Article ID: KB-128.0.2739.42 which details the problem scope and provides a rollback procedure if necessary.",
