  "description": "After applying the security update specified in KB5043080 for Windows 11, version 24H2 (Build number 10.0.26100.1742), system administrators may notice that users can experience unexpected elevation of privileges during system setup and deployment processes. This observable behavior may lead to users gaining access to higher-level system functionalities that should be restrictively managed, which could potentially expose sensitive resources to unauthorized access. System stability and control may be compromised as a result, prompting immediate attention to user access permissions and system configurations. Administrators should monitor logs for unauthorized access events following the installation for any irregularities in user privileges and tasks executed.",
