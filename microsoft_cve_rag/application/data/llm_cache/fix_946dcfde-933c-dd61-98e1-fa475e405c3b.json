  "description": "**Fix Overview**:\n\nTo remedy issues caused by problematic channel files in CrowdStrike Falcon on Windows hosts, follow the outlined remediation steps:\n\n1. Have your Falcon administrator open a support case on the CrowdStrike support portal with the required information, including the case title and CID.\n\n2. CrowdStrike support will initiate the remediation process targeting the specified customer environment.\n\n3. The remediation will quarantine the problematic channel file, preventing any further system crashes.\n\n4. Once completed, reboot the affected hosts to recover from the issue.\n\n5. Ensure that each targeted Windows host connects to the CrowdStrike cloud to effectively quarantine the problematic file.\n   \na. This process involves moving the channel file to a designated quarantine directory, thus disabling its potential to cause crashes.\n\n6. Post-reboot, the host may still experience a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) once or twice as the bad content is processed.\n   \na. If the host ceases to experience BSOD, the remediation was successful.\n\n7. Optionally, an account administrator may delete the quarantined files via the Falcon console after remediation.\n\n**Details**:\n- Remediation requires a connection to the CrowdStrike cloud.\n- For optimal performance, connect through a wired Ethernet connection and minimize WAN load prior to remediation. \n",
