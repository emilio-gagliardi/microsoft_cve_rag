  "description": "An observable behavior related to the SCCM (System Center Configuration Manager) may occur where updates cannot be added via the update source due to a corrupted registry.pol file located in the group policy machine folder at C:\\Windows\\System32\\GroupPolicy\\Machine\\registry.pol. This corruption can result in incomplete feature updates or malfunctioning of scheduled tasks and policies, particularly when devices do not complete necessary reboots, leading to further complications with policy application. To mitigate these issues, it is recommended to delete or rename the corrupted registry.pol file and clear the local group policy cache to force a refresh of the policies.",
