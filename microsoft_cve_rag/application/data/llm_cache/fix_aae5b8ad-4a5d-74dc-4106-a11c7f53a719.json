  "description": "**Fix Overview**:\n\nTo enhance security and simplify upgrades for Domain Controllers (DC), the following actions are recommended:\n\n1. Limit the roles of your DC to hosting only Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) and DNS.\n2. Avoid installing unnecessary software on the DC, as this can introduce potential vulnerabilities and complicate upgrades.\n3. If DHCP is required, consider migrating it to a separate machine or a Layer-3 device.\n4. Use a service account with delegated permissions for DHCP to manage security effectively.\n\n**Details**:\nBy restricting the roles of your DC and managing software installations wisely, you can reduce the risk of exploitation and streamline future upgrades. Migrating DHCP to a different device can help in minimizing the attack surface of your DC while maintaining operational efficiency.",
