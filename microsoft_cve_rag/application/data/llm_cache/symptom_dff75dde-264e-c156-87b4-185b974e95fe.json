  "description": "After the installation of the August 2024 security updates, some users may experience an issue where they are inadvertently tricked into executing malicious files. This is particularly concerning in environments utilizing Windows 11 Version 24H2 (Build 10.0.26100.1457) and earlier Windows 10 builds ranging from versions 21H2 to 22H2, as outlined in KB Articles KB5041571, KB5041592, and KB5041580. As a result, affected users may notice unexpected behavior, such as unauthorized changes to their files or applications executing without their explicit consent. This symptom can lead to a significant compromise of system security and user data integrity, necessitating urgent attention from system administrators. Therefore, it's critical that admins ensure users are aware and that the relevant security updates are correctly applied to mitigate this risk.",
