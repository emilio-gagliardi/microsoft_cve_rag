  "description": "Hypervisor-driven code integrity bypass occurs when Windows incorrectly permits kernel-mode pages to be marked with read, write, and execute permissions, compromising the integrity of the hvci feature. Attackers can exploit this by executing a crafted script at an administrator level, leveraging a signed driver to evade code integrity checks.",
