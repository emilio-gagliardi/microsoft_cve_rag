  "description": "Users may experience unexpected execution of code during browsing sessions with Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) version 127.0.2651.98. This observable behavior could manifest as unusual application behavior, such as unexpected prompts or crashes, which arise when a malicious actor exploits the remote code execution vulnerability identified as CVE-2024-38219. Although the attacker may need additional exploitation techniques due to the high attack complexity, end users may notice compromised functionality or performance degradation in their browsing experience. It is crucial for system administrators to ensure the latest patches, like KB-127.0.2651.98, are applied to mitigate this risk.",
