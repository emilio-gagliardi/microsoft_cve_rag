  "description": "The report highlights an issue with Windows 11 where the staged rollout of updates has caused the 'Show Desktop' feature to auto-hide unexpectedly. Users installing updates for build 23H2 and 22H2 reported that the right side tray Copilot icon did not deploy, affecting their taskbar settings. The only resolution found involves manually toggling the setting for the auto-hide feature back on through the taskbar behavior configuration. This behavior may indicate an inconsistency in the staged rollout process and how features are made available to end users. Administrators need to be aware of these update discrepancies to manage user experience effectively.",
