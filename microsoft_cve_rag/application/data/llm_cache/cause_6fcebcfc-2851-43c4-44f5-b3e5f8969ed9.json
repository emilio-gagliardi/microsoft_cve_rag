  "description": "The underlying cause of the issue pertains to an improper user-agent filter on the URL being used to download the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). This filter inadvertently blocks requests coming from certain automation tools, which leads to failed download attempts. The filtering mechanism requires regular updates to the user-agent string to align with current browsers like Chrome, Edge, or Firefox. Users need to craft and replace this user-agent string frequently to maintain access to the required download resources. Affected products involve various builds of JRE, particularly those retrieved from Oracle's repository, requiring a stable connection to download the correct update package efficiently.",
