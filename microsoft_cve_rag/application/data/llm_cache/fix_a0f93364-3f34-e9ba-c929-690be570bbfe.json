  "description": "**Fix Overview**:\n\nTo address potential BitLocker suspension issues that may arise from UEFI certificate updates:\n\n1. Investigate the UEFI certificates on impacted laptops to ensure they are up-to-date and valid.\n2. Check for any TPM (Trusted Platform Module) related WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) events that may affect BitLocker functionality.\n3. Be aware that entering hibernation may impact the BitLocker suspension counter, as suspensions can be counted during reboots. Ensure that users are not using hibernation without allowing the system to fully reboot, as this may lead to unexpected BitLocker suspension.\n\n**Details**:\n- For more details on suspending BitLocker using PowerShell, refer to the [PowerShell BitLocker module](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/bitlocker/suspend-bitlocker?view=windowsserver2022-ps). (LLM Synthesized)\n\n**Preconditions**:\n- Verify the machine is using a valid TPM and that the BitLocker service is correctly configured.\n- Conduct these checks before any scheduled or automatic updates to minimize disruption.",
