  "description": "In a multimonitor configuration, users may experience unexpected movement of desktop icons or alignment issues when attempting to utilize Copilot in Windows (in preview). This is a known issue affecting Windows 10 machines using the update. If the taskbar is positioned vertically on the screen's sides, Copilot functionality is not supported, further complicating the user experience. The organization should be cautious as this rollout could prevent effective access to Copilot, thereby impacting multiple users relying on this functionality. A known workaround has been announced, emphasizing that Copilot may not be available to systems configured with multiple monitors until a fix is provided in future updates.",
