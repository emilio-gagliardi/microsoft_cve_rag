  "description": "The system experiences abnormal behavior due to an elevation of privilege issue associated with the Windows kernel. Users on affected system builds, including versions 10.0.19045.4291, 10.0.19044.4291, 10.0.22631.3447, 10.0.22000.2899, and 10.0.22621.3447, may notice unexpected access or privilege errors during operations that require elevated permissions. This behavior might manifest as unusual error messages or restrictions when attempting to perform administrative tasks. The presence of this issue could lead to an increased risk of unauthorized actions potentially affecting the integrity of the system. Administrators are encouraged to review KB articles KB-5036910, KB-5036894, KB-5036893, and KB-5036892 for detailed guidance and remediation steps.",
