  "description": "A recurring issue has been identified in the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC), where item-level targeting for computer groups is erroneously switching to a 'user' context. This behavior is linked to a graphical user interface (GUI) malfunction, as confirmed by checking the registry XML files which correctly display the intended computer context. Despite user attempts to reset the classification back to 'computer group', the settings revert automatically to 'user'. Such instability negatively impacts the management of Group Policy and affects enterprise deployment scenarios, specifically under the context of using the registry for policy configuration. For more details, consult KB-041578 for updates on this issue.",
