  "description": "End users on affected Windows systems may experience unauthorized access to elevated privileges, which can facilitate unapproved modifications to protected files and system settings. This issue primarily arises on systems running Windows 10 and Windows 11, particularly in versions ranging from 21H2 to 24H2, affecting both x64 and ARM64 architectures. Users may notice unexpected behaviors or changes in system configurations, potentially leading to security concerns as malicious alterations could be made without user awareness or consent. To address this, Microsoft has released several security updates outlined in KB articles such as KB5044285, KB5044284, and KB5044273, which should be urgently applied to mitigate these risks.",
