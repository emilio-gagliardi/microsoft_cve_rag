  "description": "Upon applying the updates listed in KB-5036925, KB-5036910, KB-5036909, KB-5036899, KB-5036896, KB-5036894, and KB-5036893 for Windows builds 10.0.19045.4291, 10.0.19044.4291, and others, users may observe that their systems skip the normal secure boot verification process during startup. This can manifest as the operating system booting without enforcing the expected security checks, potentially allowing unsigned drivers to load. System administrators might notice that previously configured secure boot policies are not being applied correctly, leading to a less secure system state. The issue may result in significant security implications, as it allows for the possibility of executing unauthorized code or drivers during the boot process. Overall, this behavior can compromise the integrity of the system if left unresolved, prompting immediate attention from IT departments.",
