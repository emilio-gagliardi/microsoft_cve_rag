  "description": "**Fix Overview**:\n\nTo address the issue with the recovery partition size requirements introduced in the cumulative updates since 2024-01:\n\n1. Increase the size of the recovery partition to meet the new requirements.\n2. For manual intervention, connect to each affected workstation to resize the partition.\n3. If multiple systems are affected, use partition editing software to adjust the partitions accordingly and then apply the changes.\n\n**Details**:\nUsing proper partition editing software allows you to rearrange partitions to create sufficient space for the recovery partition. Note that manual sizing may only resolve the issue for about half of the affected endpoints, which could require substantial time and effort particularly in environments with numerous PCs. Additionally, employing a Windows Update reset script can often resolve subsequent update issues. These scripts are widely available and perform similar functions. (LLM Synthesized)\n\n**Preconditions**:\n- Ensure all critical data is backed up before modifying partitions.\n- It may be advisable to schedule downtime for the workstations involved during the resizing process.",
