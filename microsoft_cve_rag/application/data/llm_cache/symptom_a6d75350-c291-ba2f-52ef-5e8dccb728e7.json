  "description": "Users may observe unauthorized access to sensitive resources following the exploitation of a privilege elevation vulnerability in the Microsoft Streaming Service, as noted in security updates KB5039212 and KB5039211, affecting Windows 10 and Windows 11 systems. Specifically, end users on affected installations may experience an inability to prevent unauthorized actions due to escalated privileges in the operating system. This can lead to serious data leakage or unauthorized modifications to protected files. Systems impacted include Windows 10 version 22H2 across various architectures (x64 and 32-bit) and multiple builds in Windows 11 version 23H2. System administrators should monitor for any unusual activity or unauthorized changes to system configurations and files as a symptom of this issue.",
