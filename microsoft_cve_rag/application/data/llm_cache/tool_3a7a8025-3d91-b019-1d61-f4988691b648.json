  "description": "The Windows Update Catalog is an online repository of software updates and patches for Microsoft products. It allows system administrators to search for and download updates manually rather than relying solely on automatic updates through Windows Update. This tool is useful for deploying updates in environments where additional control and testing of updates are required before installation. By accessing the catalog, administrators can find specific KB (Knowledge Base) articles, view update descriptions, and determine the appropriate updates for their systems. It's an essential resource for managing patching strategies effectively.",
