  "description": "After updating to Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) version 118.0.2088.46, users may experience intermittent issues with file downloads, where downloads may fail or get stuck. This behavior can result in frustration for end users, as they are unable to seamlessly download files needed for their tasks. The update, documented under KB-118.0.2088.46, aims to address known vulnerabilities related to downloads, but it is essential for users to verify their Edge version to ensure they are operating with the secure release.",
