  "description": "After installing the security updates for Windows OS builds, users may observe a high loss of confidentiality associated with the mshtml platform. This may manifest as unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, where personal data or corporate security details are revealed to attackers due to improper input handling in web pages. Affected systems include Windows 11 Version 23H2 (10.0.22631.4317), Windows 10 Version 22H2 (10.0.19045.5011), and more as indicated by KB articles KB5044285, KB5044273, and others. System administrators should be vigilant for instances where critical data may be accessed without appropriate permissions, highlighting the importance of timely patch deployment across all supported Windows versions as specified.",
