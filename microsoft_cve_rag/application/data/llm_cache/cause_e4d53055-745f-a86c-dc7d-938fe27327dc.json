  "description": "The vulnerability is caused by a numeric truncation error in the Windows Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS), which could allow remote code execution when a malicious server interacts with a vulnerable client. This issue occurs as certain data processed by RRAS is not adequately checked for overflow or truncation, leading to potential exploitation over the network.",
