  "description": "After applying security updates associated with KB5044285, KB5044284, KB5044280, and KB5044273, users may observe unauthorized elevation of privileges resulting from poorly configured remote registry services. This behavior is particularly notable in systems running Windows 11 versions 24H2, 23H2, 22H2, and 21H2 (build numbers 10.0.26100.2033, 10.0.22631.4317, 10.0.22621.4317, and 10.0.22000.3260 respectively). End users and system administrators might experience unexpected access to sensitive resources, which signifies a serious flaw that permits attackers to manipulate system settings and configurations without appropriate authorization. This unexpected behavior could lead to data exposure and integrity risks, and potentially disrupt services across the network. Thus, it is crucial for administrators to monitor for unusual privilege changes post-update to mitigate risks associated with this vulnerability.",
