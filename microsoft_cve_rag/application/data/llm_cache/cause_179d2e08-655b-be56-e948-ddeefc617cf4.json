  "description": "The underlying cause of CVE-2023-35633 is a Windows kernel elevation of privilege vulnerability that allows an attacker to potentially gain system privileges. This issue arises from the handling of read/write/execute capabilities by the Windows kernel, enabling exploitation either by local access (e.g., keyboard, console) or through user interaction. The vulnerability exists across various builds of Windows, specifically affecting versions including 10.0.10240.20345 and earlier builds as listed under KB-5033379. The exploitation may occur without user interaction and is noted to possess low attack complexity; thus, an attacker could consistently target vulnerable components under certain configurations. The severity is marked as important with a CVSS score of 7.8, indicating a significant impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability for affected resources managed under the same security authority.",
