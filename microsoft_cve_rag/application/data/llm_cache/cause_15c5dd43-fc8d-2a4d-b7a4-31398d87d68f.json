  "description": "The Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) spoofing vulnerability arises from improper neutralization of input during web page generation, allowing attackers to craft specially formulated URLs that manipulate the browser's behavior to redirect users to potentially malicious sites. This vulnerability hinges on the execution of JavaScript without sufficient input validation, facilitating cross-site scripting (CWE-79) attacks. The exploit does not require high privileges but depends on user interaction to trigger the vulnerability by clicking affected links.",
