  "description": "The underlying cause of the issues is the activation of the 'ml-kem' feature in Chrome version 131, which is resulting in incompatibility with certain TLS middleboxes. This switch leads to disruptions in service, particularly affecting applications that rely on these middleboxes for secure communications. Users have noted that this issue is not related to other reported problems, such as those affecting ServiceNow. The suggested workaround involves disabling the feature by setting the registry key: software\\policies\\google\\chrome\\postquantumkeyagreementenabled to 0. This adjustment helps restore compatibility and ensures that data transmission can proceed without hitches when interacting with these middleboxes.",
