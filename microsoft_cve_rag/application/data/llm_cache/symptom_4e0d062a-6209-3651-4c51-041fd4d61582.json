  "description": "End users may experience unauthorized remote code execution when connecting to a malicious SQL server using the Microsoft WDAC OLE DB provider. This occurs in Windows 10 and Windows 11 systems (build numbers 10.0.22631.3593, 10.0.22621.3593, 10.0.22000.2960, among others) with KB articles KB-5037788, KB-5037771, KB-5037770, and KB-5037768 applied. If an authenticated user is tricked into engaging with a compromised SQL server, the server can exploit the vulnerability silently, leading to arbitrary code execution within the context of the user\u2019s session. Consequently, users may notice unusual behavior from their SQL client applications, such as unexpected prompts, crashes, or unauthorized data access that disrupt normal operations and compromise data integrity.",
