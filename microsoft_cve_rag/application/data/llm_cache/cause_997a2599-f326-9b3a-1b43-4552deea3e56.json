  "description": "The underlying technical condition leading to the denial of service is linked to a flaw within the Microsoft QUIC protocol implementation, specifically affecting PowerShell 7.3 and other related software products. This flaw allows remote attackers to exploit the network-bound vulnerability without requiring any prior authorization or user interaction, resulting in a complete loss of service availability. The affected build numbers include Windows 11 for x64-based systems (10.0.20348.2031, 10.0.22621.2428) and associated updates documented in KB articles KB5031364, KB5031354, and KB5031358. This situation arises because of the protocol being exploitable at a network level, increasing the risk of DoS attacks across diverse environments.",
