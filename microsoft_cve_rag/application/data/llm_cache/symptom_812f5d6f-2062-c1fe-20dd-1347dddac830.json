  "description": "The auto-upgrade feature in the software version 2.3.6.0 fails to initiate an upgrade if the machine does not meet the operating system or .NET runtime requirements. This failure is due to improvements made in the auto-upgrade detection process, which may lead to unexpected upgrade delays or failures for system administrators managing the updates. As a result, environments could potentially see an increase in unsupported configurations if these requirements are not met prior to upgrade attempts. Therefore, it is crucial for administrators to ensure compliance with these preconditions to facilitate a smooth upgrade process. For further details, refer to the bug fixes introduced in version 2.3.6.0.",
