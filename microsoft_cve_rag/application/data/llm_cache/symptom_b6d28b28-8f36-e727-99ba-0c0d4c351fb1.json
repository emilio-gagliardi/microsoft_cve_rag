  "description": "Users may experience a degradation of security provided by Windows' Mark of the Web (MOTW) feature, which is intended to warn them about potentially unsafe files. Following the exploitation of CVE-2024-38217, users could encounter scenarios where downloaded files, which would normally be flagged by MOTW, are accepted without the standard security prompts. This can lead to a heightened risk of executing malicious files that bypass MOTW protections, resulting in inadvertent exposure to unsafe content. The affected products include Windows 11 (various builds) and earlier Windows 10 versions, specifically builds 10.0.22621.4169, 10.0.22000.3197, 10.0.22631.4169, and 10.0.26100.1742, with corresponding KB updates (KB5043080, KB5043076, KB5043067, and KB5043064). The integrity and availability of security features such as SmartScreen checks may also be compromised, leading to potential user confusion and increased vulnerability to attacks.",
