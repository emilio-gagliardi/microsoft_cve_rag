  "description": "The core cause of CVE-2023-36014 stems from a flaw in the Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) software that allows unauthorized command execution locally by exploiting improper handling of user interaction. The vulnerability is triggered when an attacker convinces a user to open a specially crafted file, which leads to the execution of malicious code on the local system. The issue is specifically present in build numbers 119.0.2151.58 and 118.0.5993.136, contributing to a significant loss of confidentiality and integrity. The corresponding KB Article for resolution is KB-119.0.2151.58.",
