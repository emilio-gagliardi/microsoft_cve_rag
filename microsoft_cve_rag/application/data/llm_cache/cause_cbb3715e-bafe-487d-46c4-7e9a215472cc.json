  "description": "The underlying cause of CVE-2024-20674 is a flaw in the Windows Kerberos implementation that allows for security feature bypass. Specifically, this issue arises from improper handling of Kerberos messages, enabling an authenticated attacker to exploit the protocol by performing a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack. The attacker must first gain access to a restricted adjacent network, which can be done using local network spoofing techniques. Once in position, the attacker sends a crafted Kerberos message that impersonates the authentication server, thereby circumventing the intended security validations. This vulnerability affects multiple Windows operating system builds including Windows 10 and Windows 11, where critical security features designed to validate authentication requests are insufficiently enforced, leading to potential complete loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of network resources.",
