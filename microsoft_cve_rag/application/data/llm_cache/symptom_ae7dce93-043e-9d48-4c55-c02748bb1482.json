  "description": "Windows Server 2016 encountered a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) during the reboot phase after applying patch KB5041773. This incident was reported by a systems administrator who monitored the installation process closely. While the patch seemed to apply correctly upon recovery from the BSOD, the unanticipated crash indicates a potential conflict or issue related to the patch or its prerequisites. The administrator noted they had experienced issues with multiple servers, which raises concerns about the overall reliability of this specific patch for the Windows Server 2016 environment. Analysis of memory dump files is suggested for further investigation to ascertain the root cause of the BSOD event.",
