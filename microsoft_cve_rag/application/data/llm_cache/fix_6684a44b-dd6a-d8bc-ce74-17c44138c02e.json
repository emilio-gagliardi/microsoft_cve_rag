  "description": "**Fix Overview**:\n\nTo manage DHCP services efficiently in a Windows environment:\n\n1. Consider utilizing a non-domain controller (non-DC) Windows server for the DHCP service. \n2. Analyze the potential increase in your license count and administrative overhead.\n3. Maintain dynamic updates by configuring the DHCP service correctly, ensuring non-privileged accounts are specified as needed.\n4. Evaluate the feasibility of removing DHCP from Domain Controllers if appropriate, based on your company\u2019s specific architecture.\n\n**Details**:\n- Ensure that remote locations with limited bandwidth have their DHCP functions correctly configured to avoid overloading existing systems. (LLM Synthesized)\n\n**Preconditions**:\n- Assess your current server resources before implementation to prevent performance degradation.",
