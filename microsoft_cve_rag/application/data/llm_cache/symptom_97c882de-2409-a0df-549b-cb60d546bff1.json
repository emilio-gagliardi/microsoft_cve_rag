  "description": "A significant issue has arisen where multiple Windows systems suddenly become non-bootable, particularly affecting those on build numbers 19045.4170 and 19045.4291. This phenomenon appears linked to the installation of update KB5036979, though the exact mechanism remains unclear due to a lack of visible error messages on the affected devices. Users report that these machines no longer display a list of updates, complicating the troubleshooting process. Further investigation revealed that the issue could be replicated by modifying the machine's registry settings. The increasing number of affected computers raises concerns about a potential widespread problem that could mirror a zero-day scenario, warranting urgent attention from Microsoft.",
