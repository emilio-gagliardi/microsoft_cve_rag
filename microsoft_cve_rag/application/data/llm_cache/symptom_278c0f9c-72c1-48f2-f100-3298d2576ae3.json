  "description": "When creating a new Group Policy Object (GPO), the option to select user or user group for item-level targeting in the user section of the policy is missing. This leads to a situation where administrators are unable to configure specific mapping preferences for users as previously set. Users may experience unexpected behavior if their preferences are not honored due to this limitation. Administrators may not receive any notifications about mapping failures that could arise from these unconfigured settings. Refer to KB-041578 for more detailed information on this issue.",
