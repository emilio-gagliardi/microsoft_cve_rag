  "description": "The underlying issue stems from the handling of BitLocker encrypted external USB devices during the Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE) process. When multiple partitions exist on the system, such as a primary 'C:' drive and other partitions like 'D:', the recovery process may mistakenly reference the wrong partition. Additionally, if a user attempts to use a USB backup drive that is encrypted with BitLocker, WinRE prompts for the BitLocker key from that external drive instead of using the keys stored internally in Active Directory (AD). This can lead to confusion and prevent successful booting into recovery mode. It is essential for users to understand that they may need to boot from a Windows 10/11 installation medium to access recovery options if the built-in method fails. Adequate preparation and awareness are crucial to avoid recovery challenges in scenarios involving encrypted storage devices.",
