  "description": "End users of Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) version 128.0.2739.42 may experience random crashes or unresponsiveness when using the application. This behavior can manifest as unexpected shutdowns or freezes while navigating web pages, particularly those containing complex HTML content. The crashes are indicative of underlying memory corruption issues due to the reported CVE-2024-38207 vulnerability, which impacts the stability of Edge. Users may also notice intermittent failures in page loading, resulting in degraded browsing experiences. Administrators should recommend users update their Microsoft Edge installation to the latest version as per KB-128.0.2739.42 to mitigate these issues.",
