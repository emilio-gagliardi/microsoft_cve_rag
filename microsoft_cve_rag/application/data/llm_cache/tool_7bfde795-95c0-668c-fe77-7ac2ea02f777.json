  "description": "**Tool Overview**:\n\nThis tool relates to the configuration and usage of Image File Execution Options (IFEO) for managing how specific applications run on a Windows system. IFEO allows administrators to specify debugger settings and control how applications behave, especially for troubleshooting and performance enhancements.\n\n**Details**:\n1. **Configuration**: IFEO settings can be adjusted through the Windows Registry. Administrators can create entries under the `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Image File Execution Options` path for specific executables like `msedge.exe`.\n2. **Purpose**: This tool is essential for diagnosing and resolving application launch issues, as seen with Chromium-based browsers becoming unresponsive post-update.\n3. **Usage**: Changes to an IFEO entry can include setting a debugger or modifying the command-line arguments for the executable.\n4. **Caveats**: Improper configurations can lead to application crashes or unintended behavior, hence caution is advised when using this tool.\n5. **Example**: To modify the behavior of Microsoft Edge, you might add an entry in the registry that points to a custom executable or debugger to be invoked when `msedge.exe` is launched.",
