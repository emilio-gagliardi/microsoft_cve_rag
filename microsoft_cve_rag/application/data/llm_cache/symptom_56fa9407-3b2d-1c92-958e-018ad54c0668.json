  "description": "Users may experience unexpected behavior when attempting to perform operations that normally require elevated privileges on systems running affected builds of Windows. This can manifest as unauthorized access attempts being unsuccessful or unexpected errors when executing applications that require higher permissions. Specifically, on Windows 11 Version 24H2 (Build 10.0.26100.1457) and Windows Server 2022 (Server Core Installation), this can lead to usability issues where legitimate software fails to execute correctly, causing workflow disruptions. Users may also report difficulties in accessing administrative features or settings, further impacting their ability to manage the system effectively. This could create an environment where standard user tasks are impeded, resulting in frustration and additional support requests.",
