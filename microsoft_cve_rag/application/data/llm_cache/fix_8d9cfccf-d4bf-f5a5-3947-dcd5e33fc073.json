  "description": "**Fix Overview**:\n\nTo enhance the functionality of the existing PowerShell code for checking partition sizes and free space:\n\n1. Utilize the command `reagentc /info` to retrieve the Windows RE (Recovery Environment) location.\n2. Parse the output to determine the disk and partition information using regular expressions.\n3. Implement checks for remaining size and overall size of the volume where Windows RE is located, with warnings for insufficient space.\n\n**Details**:\nThis enhancement ensures that the Windows RE has adequate free space. If the remaining space is less than 250 MB, a warning is issued indicating that more space is necessary. Additionally, if the total volume size is less than 1 GB, a warning states that the RE partition needs to be larger. This proactive monitoring helps maintain system recoverability.
