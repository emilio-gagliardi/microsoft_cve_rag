  "description": "Users may experience unexpected behavior when attempting to boot their systems, particularly if they rely on the Secure Boot feature that's compromised by CVE-2024-26168. On affected builds, such as 10.0.19045.4291 and 10.0.22621.3447, there may be indications that the system is no longer verifying the integrity of the operating environment correctly. This can result in a failure to load certain operating system components or drivers, leading to system instability. Ultimately, end users could see errors during the boot sequence, making it impossible to access the system or triggering recovery environments. The issue is notable in the context of critical builds referenced in KB articles like KB-5036925 and KB-5036894, and is essential for administrators to monitor closely to maintain system operational integrity.",
