  "description": "After updating to Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) version 122.0.2365.52, users may observe warnings while attempting to access certain websites hosting content that is not secure. These warnings can manifest as dialog boxes that inform users about potential risks when accessing non-HTTPS content. This behavior indicates that the website may be vulnerable and not following recommended security practices. The prompt may lead to confusion among users who are accustomed to seamless browsing experiences. Users can check their Microsoft Edge version by clicking on the three-dot menu, navigating to 'Help and feedback', and then selecting 'About Microsoft Edge'. This update corresponds to KB-122.0.2365.52, which addresses a previously noted vulnerability in Chromium.",
