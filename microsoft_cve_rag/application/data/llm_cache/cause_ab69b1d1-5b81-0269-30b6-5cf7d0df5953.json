{
  "description": "The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow or wraparound error that affects the secure boot feature, allowing attackers to potentially bypass security measures. The issue exists within the network stack, and successful exploitation requires an attacker to have physical or administrative access to the device, enabling them to install malicious boot configuration files (BCD). This can occur under specific environmental conditions where the attacker has control over the administrative domain, thus leveraging the vulnerability to execute privileged actions.",
