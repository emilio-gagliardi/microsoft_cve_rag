  "description": "In the scenario described, the user is unable to locate the 'Show Hubs Sidebar' setting in the Edge policy files after downloading and placing the .adml and .admx files from the Edge policy page onto their domain controller. The user attempts to access this setting from both a 2019 domain controller and a Windows 10 administrative system, indicating that there is a discrepancy in available settings between versions of Edge. This suggests that certain features, such as the 'Show Hubs Sidebar' option, may not be present in the policy files for the regular version of Edge compared to Edge for Business. As a result, administrators may need to confirm which settings are available for their specific deployment of Edge or consider using the Edge for Business policy files to access features that appear to be missing in the standard version. This could lead to confusion and inefficiencies in managing browser settings across various systems in an enterprise environment.",
