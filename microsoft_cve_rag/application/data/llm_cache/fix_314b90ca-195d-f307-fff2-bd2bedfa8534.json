  "description": "**Fix Overview**:\n\nTo effectively understand and manage the integration between VPN and patch solutions, it is important to note the following:\n\n1. Acknowledge that the VPN product (from Pulse) and the patch solutions (from the Shavlik brand) operate on separate technologies and code bases.\n\n2. Review the latest guidance issued by CISA to ensure compliance and security measures are in place regarding the Ivanti Connect Secure and Ivanti Policy Secure products.\n\n3. Visit the Ivanti blog update to stay informed about security updates and FAQs that address customer inquiries regarding these products.\n\n**Details**:\nThis approach allows for clearer management and updates of both technologies and ensures that security concerns are addressed as per regulatory guidance. For ongoing questions or clarifications, reaching out to support will enhance understanding and implementation. (LLM Synthesized)",
