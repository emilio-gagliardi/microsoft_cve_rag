  "description": "The underlying cause of the upgrade issue from Windows 22H2 to 23H2 stems from the need to manually install the Latest Cumulative Update (LCU) and utilize the enablement package specific to the upgrade. This process is essential as it ensures that the necessary components and configurations are properly set to facilitate the transition from the earlier build. If the LCU is not applied beforehand, or if the enablement package is not correctly utilized, the upgrade may fail, leading to complications during system reboot. This underscores the importance of adhering to the correct update pathways prescribed by Microsoft to avoid disruption and ensure stability. Specifically, handling the bits involved in the transition is critical, which seems to be a common oversight when performing manual upgrades.",
