  "description": "**Fix Overview**:\n\nTo address issues related to the correct identification and management of the Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE) and the operating system (OS) partitions on devices with complex disk setups:\n\n1. Parse the output of `reagentc.exe /info` to identify the correct primary disk.\n2. Retrieve the WinRE path and relevant partition information to ensure it is adequately sized (minimum 1GB).\n3. Dynamically replace static disk references in scripts with the identified correct disk variables.\n4. Implement checks to determine the positioning of the OS and WinRE partitions for safe resizing or potential relocation.\n\n**Details**:\nThis method is vital for environments with multiple disks, ensuring that recovery operations remain functional. Verify that the WinRE is not on a different disk from the OS to prevent recovery failures during OS swaps. (LLM Synthesized)\n\n**Preconditions**:\n- Administrative privileges are required to execute disk management operations.\n- Backup critical data before making modifications to disk partitions.",
