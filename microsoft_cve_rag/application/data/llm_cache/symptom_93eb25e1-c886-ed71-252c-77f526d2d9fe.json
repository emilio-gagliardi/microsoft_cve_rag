  "description": "Users who were updated from Classic Teams to New Teams have reported encountering crashing issues during usage. This behavior has led to some users reverting back to Classic Teams as they find the new version unstable. The concern is that this might affect a larger part of the end-user community, particularly because updates to Teams are managed differently compared to other Microsoft 365 apps, leading to frustration among users and administrators alike.",
