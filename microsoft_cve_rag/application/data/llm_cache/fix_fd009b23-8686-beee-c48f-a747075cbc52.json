  "description": "**Fix Overview**:\n\nTo resolve the audio input issue on an older Dell device:\n\n1. Consider reverting to the official audio drivers provided by Dell, especially if you have previously installed drivers from a non-Dell source.\n2. Download and install the Dell audio drivers, ensuring they are compatible with Windows 10, as they may not offer versions for newer operating systems.\n\n**Details**:\n- Official Dell drivers are often more stable and specifically tailored for Dell hardware. Using drivers from other sources may introduce compatibility issues that lead to further problems. (LLM Synthesized)\n",
