  "description": "The cause of the issue stems from a remote code execution vulnerability in Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based), specifically in build version 119.0.2151.72. This vulnerability occurs due to the software allowing an attacker to exploit certain functionalities via local access, necessitating user interaction for successful exploitation. For example, an attacker could trick a user into downloading or opening a malicious file that performs unauthorized operations within the context of the Edge browser. The risk associated with this vulnerability includes a total loss of confidentiality, where sensitive information could be disclosed, alongside a limited ability for data modification. The remediation is provided through official fixes as documented in KB-119.0.2151.72.",
