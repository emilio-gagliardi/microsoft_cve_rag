  "description": "Users of Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) version 125.0.2535.85 may experience observable performance issues due to a heap buffer overflow in the WebRTC component, which could lead to heap corruption. This flaw was noted in CVE-2024-5493 released on June 3, 2024. Potential issues include unexpected crashes of the browser or instability while loading certain pages, especially those utilizing WebRTC features. End users may notice erratic browser behavior, which could manifest as the Edge browser freezing, not responding, or closing unexpectedly when loading specific types of content. To mitigate these issues, users are advised to upgrade to the patched version 125.0.6422.141 or later, as documented in KB-125.0.2535.85.",
