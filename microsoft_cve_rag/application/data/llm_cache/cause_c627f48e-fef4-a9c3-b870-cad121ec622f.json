  "description": "The elevation of privilege issue identified in CVE-2024-20681 stems from a flaw in the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Specifically, the vulnerability arises when the component's access controls are improperly configured, allowing an attacker to exploit local administrative privileges on the system. This situation can be triggered through unauthorized read, write, or execute commands on the subsystem. Attackers can leverage local access with keyboard or console input, or they may utilize remote access methods like SSH to gain control. Successful exploitation effectively allows an attacker to escalate their privileges, potentially compromising the entire operating system's integrity and leading to unauthorized access of critical resources.",
