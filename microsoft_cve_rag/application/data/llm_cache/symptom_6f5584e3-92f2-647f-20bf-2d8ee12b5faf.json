  "description": "In organizational environments managing Windows 11 deployments, administrators face significant challenges when enforcing update policies through WSUS (Windows Server Update Services). This setup requires the creation of a dedicated Active Directory Organizational Unit (OU) specifically for Windows 11 machines at each remote site. This involves migrating all Windows 11 machines into these OUs and establishing a new Group Policy Object (GPO) to ensure that updates are managed under a designated WSUS computer group tailored for Windows 11. The manual setup and ongoing management can be cumbersome, highlighting the complexity involved in maintaining update compliance within a diverse infrastructure. Such overhead can strain administrative resources, requiring careful planning and an understanding of hierarchical management in Active Directory for effective patch management.",
