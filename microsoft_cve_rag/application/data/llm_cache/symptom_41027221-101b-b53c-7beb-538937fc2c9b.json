  "description": "End users may experience unauthorized access to sensitive information as a result of the underlying kernel issue, particularly affecting systems running Windows 10 (build numbers: 10.0.22631.2715, 10.0.19043.3693, 10.0.19045.3693) and Windows 11 (build numbers: 10.0.22621.2715). This can manifest as the inadvertent disclosure of confidential data, including registry key values, that users typically do not have permissions to view. Relevant updates to mitigate this issue are documented in KB5032192, KB5032190, and KB5032189.",
