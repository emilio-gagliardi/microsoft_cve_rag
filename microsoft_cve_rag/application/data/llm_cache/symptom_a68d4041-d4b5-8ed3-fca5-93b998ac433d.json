  "description": "Users may experience unauthorized execution of commands within their SQL client application after connecting to a malicious SQL database. This occurs when the application is tricked into executing specially crafted replies from the server, potentially compromising sensitive data and allowing attackers to manipulate the system remotely. Users operating on Windows 11 builds 26H2 (10.0.26100.2033), 23H2 (10.0.22631.4317), 22H2 (10.0.22621.4317), and 21H2 (10.0.22000.3260), among others, may encounter significant security risks as indicated in the Microsoft KB articles: KB-5044284, KB-5044285, KB-5044280, and KB-5044273. This situation can lead to severe data breaches and operational disruptions, requiring immediate attention to ensure the integrity of the affected systems.",
