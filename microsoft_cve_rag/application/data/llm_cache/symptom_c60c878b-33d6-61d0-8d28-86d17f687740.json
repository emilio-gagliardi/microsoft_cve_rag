  "description": "After applying the security updates from KB5034765 and KB5034766 associated with the Windows Server 2022 and Windows 11 builds, users may experience a total loss of availability in their Hyper-V environments. This can manifest as the inability to access virtual machines hosted on the Hyper-V platform, effectively rendering the VMs inaccessible to both admins and users. The affected builds include Windows 11 Version 23H2 for x64-based systems (10.0.22631.3155), Version 22H2 for x64-based systems (10.0.22621.3155), and Version 21H2 for x64-based systems (10.0.22000.2777). As the Hyper-V guest attempts to disrupt operations, administrators will notice significant downtime, which can severely impact business operations and availability of critical applications. This issue may require immediate attention to restore normal functionality, highlighting the importance of monitoring Hyper-V environments post-update.",
