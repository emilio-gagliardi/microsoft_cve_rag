  "description": "The Windows graphics component may unintentionally expose sensitive memory contents due to an information disclosure vulnerability identified by CVE-2024-43508. Users on affected builds, including Windows 11 Version 24H2 for x64 (10.0.26100.2033) and Version 23H2 for x64 (10.0.22631.4317), could experience compromised data confidentiality. This could manifest as the potential exposure of small portions of heap memory to unauthorized entities. Administrators monitoring these systems should be vigilant for unusual behavior or suspicious access patterns related to memory access after applying updates from KB5044284 and KB5044285. Such exposure may not be immediately visible to users, yet it underscores the importance of keeping systems updated to mitigate risk.",
