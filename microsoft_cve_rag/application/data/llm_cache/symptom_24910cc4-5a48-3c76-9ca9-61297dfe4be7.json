  "description": "The Exchange 2019 server is not displaying available updates in the Windows Update interface, despite having recent patches applied. Administrators may find that the server build version appears outdated, and no further Exchange-related patches show up during manual scans for updates. This could indicate issues with the update configuration or availability of the updates. System administrators tasked with maintaining Exchange environments might experience confusion due to the lack of expected visibility for critical updates needed for optimal security and functionality. Ensuring the correct settings for update installations is crucial for maintaining system integrity and support.",
