  "description": "The installation of a specific knowledge base article (KB60661) fails on a newly cloned Windows 10 device. The issue arises because the clone process did not transfer a recovery partition, which is crucial for certain patch installations. As a result, the system is unable to revert or repair itself using standard recovery methods, potentially leaving it vulnerable or inoperable in the event of system issues.",
