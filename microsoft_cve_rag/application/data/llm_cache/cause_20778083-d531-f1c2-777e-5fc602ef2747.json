  "description": "The cause of the Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) issue is linked to a problematic driver file associated with CrowdStrike, specifically located in the 'c:\\windows\\system32\\drivers\\crowdstrike' directory. The specific file triggering the BSOD is identified as 'c - 00000291*.sys', which appears to lead to system instability during normal operation. This issue has reportedly affected multiple systems, necessitating immediate intervention by support teams during priority one (P1) calls. The workaround involves booting into Safe Mode or the Windows Recovery Environment to delete the problematic driver file before returning to normal system operation. Given the impact on numerous systems, this issue highlights a significant compatibility concern that needs addressing by CrowdStrike to prevent recurrence.",
