  "description": "The underlying condition leading to the Microsoft Message Queuing denial-of-service scenario is rooted in a flaw in the network component handling requests. Specifically, this flaw allows an attacker to exploit message queuing protocols, leading to a complete loss of availability for the affected services. The vulnerability is classified as remotely exploitable, with the potential for attackers to engage from outside the local network. The affected systems include various builds of Windows Server and Windows 10, particularly those listed under build numbers 10.0.19044.3930, 10.0.19045.3930, and others. The issue persists regardless of user interaction and can cause sustained denial of service until remedial measures, such as applying the patches identified in KB-5034134 and related articles, are implemented.",
