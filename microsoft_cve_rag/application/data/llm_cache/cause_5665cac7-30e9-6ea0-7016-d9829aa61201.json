  "description": "The underlying cause of CVE-2023-36405 is a Windows kernel elevation of privilege vulnerability that occurs due to improper handling of certain requests, allowing an attacker with low privileges to exploit the flaw. This vulnerability necessitates local access to the system, enabling an attacker to read, write, or execute malicious code. Specifically, if an attacker successfully manipulates a race condition within the kernel, they can elevate their privileges to gain system-level access. This issue affects multiple Windows products, including builds 10.0.22631.2715, 10.0.19043.3693, 10.0.22621.2715, and 10.0.19045.3693, with corresponding KB articles KB-5032192, KB-5032190, and KB-5032189 detailing the necessary security updates to mitigate this risk.",
