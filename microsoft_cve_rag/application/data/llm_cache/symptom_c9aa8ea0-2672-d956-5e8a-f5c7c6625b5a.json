  "symptom_label": "RecoveryPartitionDisabledDueToWmiIssues",
  "description": "The recovery partition may be disabled, which poses a risk for system recovery processes. This symptom can be inferred from the inability of WMI to return usable freespace data for recovery partitions, as indicated by the checks performed in the provided PowerShell snippet. Systems affected include those running Microsoft Windows with unknown build numbers; the potential impact is that recovery options may not function during critical recovery situations, leading to data loss or extended downtime.
