  "description": "The audio management system in Windows 11 experiences issues with autoplay notifications, leading to a lack of pop-up alerts that typically indicate the connection of audio devices such as microphones, headphones, and speakers. Users note that when the 'Always notify' settings are enabled, the expected dialog containing device options sometimes fails to appear, even when system notifications are present. This behavior suggests that the underlying applet controlling these notifications may not be functioning properly due to dependencies on the installed audio manager software. As a result, users may overlook important device connection prompts, potentially affecting their ability to manage audio device settings effectively. This issue is particularly noticeable during device connection events, emphasizing the importance of the audio management system in user experience.",
