  "description": "After upgrading a Server 2022 from Server 2016 and applying the February update (KB5034129), users report that Google Chrome fails to launch properly. Instead of opening as expected, the browser starts with a completely white screen and closes itself after approximately 30 seconds of attempting to load. This issue affects all versions of Google Chrome installed on the server. A resolution involves deleting a specific registry key: 'HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Image File Execution Options\\chrome.exe', which restores the browser's functionality. This symptom indicates a significant disruption to the browser's usability for end users on this server configuration.",
