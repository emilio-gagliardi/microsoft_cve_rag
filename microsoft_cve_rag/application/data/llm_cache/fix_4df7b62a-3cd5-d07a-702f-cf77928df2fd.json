  "description": "**Fix Overview**:\n\nTo enable LDAPS support for domain controllers:\n\n1. Install a certificate from a public certificate authority such as DigiCert on your domain controllers.\n\n2. If you are using a load balancer, configure it for LDAPS and add your domain controllers for redundancy.\n\n3. Optionally, set up DNS round robin for fault tolerance, although this is less reliable than a load balancer.\n\n4. Ensure that the certificate includes all fully qualified domain names (FQDN) of your domain controllers, and consider using a wildcard certificate if needed.\n\n**Details**:\n- Using a load balancer enhances redundancy and reliability.\n- DNS round robin can provide basic load distribution but may present reliability challenges compared to the load balancer configuration.",
