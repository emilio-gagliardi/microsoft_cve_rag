  "description": "Users may experience unexpected exposure of sensitive information when utilizing the Windows Remote Access Connection Manager on affected builds, specifically including those such as 10.0.19045.4291 and 10.0.22000.2899. This issue arises due to an information disclosure vulnerability, which may result in the unintended revealing of confidential data. System administrators should remain vigilant as this could potentially impact data security protocols, especially when accessing remote systems. It is crucial to ensure that patches from KB-5037788, KB-5037771, KB-5037768, and KB-5036894 are applied to affected systems to mitigate such risks and enhance protection for user data.",
