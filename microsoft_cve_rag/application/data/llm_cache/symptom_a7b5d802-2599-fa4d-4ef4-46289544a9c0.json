  "description": "End users may experience unintended execution of arbitrary code within their SQL client application when connected to a malicious SQL database. This happens after they are tricked into establishing a trusted connection to the database via their SQL client application, leading to the execution of instructions that could manipulate system processes and access sensitive data. Impacted builds include Windows 10 (builds 10.0.10240.20469, 10.0.19044.4046) and Windows 11 (builds 10.0.22631.3155, 10.0.22000.2777), as referenced in KB Article IDs KB5034763 and others. Users may notice unusual activity or performance degradation as a result of the unauthorized operations that execute under their application context.",
