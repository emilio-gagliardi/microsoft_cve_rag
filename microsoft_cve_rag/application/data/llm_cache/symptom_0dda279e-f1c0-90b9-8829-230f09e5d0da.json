  "description": "When updating a DELL notebook, users may experience an issue where the system fails to complete the update process and displays an 'undoing changes' message. This symptom indicates a rollback procedure triggered by a failed update, which could potentially lead to a full system reset on the device. This issue seems to be unique to the DELL notebook in this scenario, while updates on other devices, like older HP notebooks, have not encountered similar issues.",
