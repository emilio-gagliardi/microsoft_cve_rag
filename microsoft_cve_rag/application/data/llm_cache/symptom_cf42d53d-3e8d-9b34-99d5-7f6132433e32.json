  "description": "After exploiting the Bitlocker security feature bypass vulnerability (CVE-2024-20666), users may experience unauthorized access to data that was previously encrypted by Bitlocker on their devices. This breach can occur without any user interaction, making it particularly concerning as physical access is the only requirement for the attacker. Affected products include various builds of Windows 10 and Windows 11, such as those noted in the release, with significant builds including 10.0.19045.3930 for Windows 10 and 10.0.22631.3007 for Windows 11. System administrators should refer to KB articles KB-5034134, KB-5034123, and others listed to understand the impact and necessary remediation steps. The severity of this issue is classified as important, with serious implications for the confidentiality and integrity of the data managed on these systems.",
