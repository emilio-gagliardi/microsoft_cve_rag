  "description": "The observed behavior involves the removal of the Copilot icon from Microsoft Edge through changes made to specific registry keys. System administrators may notice that after applying the registry settings, the side Copilot icon no longer appears, and the Bing Chat feature is disabled on the new tab page. The registry keys modified include 'hubssidebarenabled' and 'newtabpagebingchatenabled', both set to the value '00000000'. This issue affects Microsoft Edge installations, and the changes are applicable regardless of the build number. The KB Article associated with this guidance is KB9000005, providing further details for administrators seeking to implement these policies.",
