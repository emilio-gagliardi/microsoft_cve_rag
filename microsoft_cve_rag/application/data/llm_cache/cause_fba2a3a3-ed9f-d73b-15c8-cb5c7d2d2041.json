  "description": "The root cause of the issue revolves around the sizing of the Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE) partition. As Windows systems evolve, the WinRE partition has shown a consistent increase in used space, attributed to accumulating updates and recovery tools which are included in cumulative updates. In particular, the trend indicates that a partition size of 1 GB may no longer suffice for maintaining adequate recovery capabilities as the data footprint grows over time. Users upgrading from Windows 10 Pro to Windows 11 Pro experienced significant increases in used space within just months of the upgrade. As such, a recommendation for a 2 GB recovery partition has emerged to ensure sufficient space is available for ongoing updates and recovery features moving forward. This proactive measure may help prevent issues related to space constraints in future system updates.",
