  "description": "The underlying issue stems from an information disclosure vulnerability in Microsoft Access, permitting attackers to obtain a victim\u2019s NTLM hash. This vulnerability can be exploited when a user opens an Office document embedded with an Access database linked to a remote SQL Server database using Windows NT authentication. It triggers forced authentication, resulting in the unintentional exposure of NTLM hashes each time a table in Access is updated via a remote connection on port 1433, or any other port, which could include common ports like 80 or 443. Despite reports submitted to Microsoft regarding this flaw as early as January 2023, a timely resolution has not been provided, classified as low/no severity by MSRC, leading to the release of a micropatch by 0patch for Microsoft Office as a workaround.",
