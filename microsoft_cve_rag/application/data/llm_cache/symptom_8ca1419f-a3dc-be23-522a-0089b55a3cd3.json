  "description": "After installing the security updates related to remote desktop client vulnerabilities (CVE-2024-21307) on systems running affected versions, users may experience unresponsiveness within the application. This can manifest as delays in processing commands, freezing of the remote session, or complete failures to initiate connections. This symptom can be particularly frustrating for users relying on remote access for their tasks, as they may find themselves unable to interact with their remote desktops effectively. The impact could be seen across various Windows 10 and Windows 11 build numbers, with updates associated to KB-5034121, KB-5034122, KB-5034123, and KB-5034134. Therefore, in these environments, it is vital for system administrators to monitor user feedback closely and consider implementing workarounds or additional patches until a permanent solution is confirmed.",
