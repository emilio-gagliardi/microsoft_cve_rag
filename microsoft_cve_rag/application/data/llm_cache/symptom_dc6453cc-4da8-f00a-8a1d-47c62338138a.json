  "description": "End users may experience unexpected crashes or erratic behavior when using Google Chrome build 127.0.2651.98 and earlier. This issue arises due to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability that can lead to heap corruption. When users visit malicious or improperly crafted HTML pages, the browser may exhibit performance instability, which could manifest as freezing or closing unexpectedly. Additionally, system administrators may notice increased reports of application crashes related to Chrome in their monitoring tools. Users are advised to update to Google Chrome version 127.0.6533.99 or later, as detailed in KB-127.0.2651.98, to mitigate this behavior.",
