  "description": "The observed behavior resulting from the DHCP server service vulnerability (CVE-2024-26212) is a denial of service that affects multiple Windows Server products. Administrators managing affected systems may notice a total loss of availability, preventing clients from obtaining IP addresses, which in turn disrupts network access. This impact may lead to significant operational challenges, especially in environments where DHCP is critical for network connectivity. Systems impacted across various versions include Windows Server 2016, 2019, 2022, and 2012 R2, as detailed in KB articles KB-5036910, KB-5036909, KB-5036899, and KB-5036896. If not addressed, the vulnerability can halt service, complicating the recovery of DHCP operations until the patches are correctly implemented.",
