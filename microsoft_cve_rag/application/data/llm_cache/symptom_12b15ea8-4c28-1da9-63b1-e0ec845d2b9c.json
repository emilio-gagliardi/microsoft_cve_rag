  "description": "The upgrade to Windows 11 necessitates that the virtual machine (VM) is configured with Virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM) and UEFI Secure Boot settings. If a VMware VM does not have these settings enabled, users may experience issues during the upgrade, resulting in a failure to meet system requirements for Windows 11. This can also affect the performance and features that depend on these security enhancements, such as virtualization-based security (VBS). The post emphasizes confirming that TPM 2.0 is physically enabled and instructs the use of mbr2gpt for legacy boot conversions. Proper configurations are essential for ensuring a smooth transition from Windows 10 to Windows 11 in virtualized environments.",
