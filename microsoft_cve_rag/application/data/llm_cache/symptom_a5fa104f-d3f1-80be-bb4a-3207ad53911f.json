  "description": "Windows Server 2022 systems unexpectedly do not receive auto-approved updates because the existing WSUS approval rules do not encompass the Server 24h2 OS build. This results in a situation where necessary patches applicable for the OS are not propagated to the relevant systems. Administrators may observe that updates designated for installation are not found on these servers despite being configured for automatic approval. This discrepancy can lead to unpatched environments and potential exposure to known issues. Issues around patch management processes can increase operational overhead as system administrators need to manually verify and distribute updates that should have been automatically applied.",
