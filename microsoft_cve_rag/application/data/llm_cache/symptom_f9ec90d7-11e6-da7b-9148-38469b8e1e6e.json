  "description": "End users may experience a situation where a system behaves unexpectedly, requiring their active engagement to exploit a local vulnerability in the Windows libarchive component. Specifically, if an authorized attacker convinces a user to open a malicious document, the user might unknowingly trigger remote code execution, which can lead to severe outcomes. This situation can manifest in regular operations where a user is prompted to take actions that put their system at risk, creating a context where users may not be aware of the implications of their actions. System administrators may need to address this behavior to prevent potential breaches. This issue affects systems running Windows 11 for both x64-based (build 10.0.22631.3007, KB5034123) and ARM64-based versions (build 10.0.22631.3007, KB5034123), as well as Windows 11 version 22H2 and 23H2 (builds 10.0.22621.3007 and 10.0.25398.643 respectively).",
