  "description": "End users running the affected versions of the Microsoft WDAC OLE DB provider for SQL Server may experience unexpected remote code execution compromises due to being tricked into connecting to a malicious SQL server. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary code within the context of the user's SQL client application. System administrators may observe unusual behavior or system performance issues as unauthorized code is executed, or they might find logs indicative of successful exploitation attempts. As the impact escalates, users could notice erratic application behavior, session terminations, or data corruption, all stemming from the unauthorized actions taken by the malicious code. Affected products include Windows 10 builds [10, 0, 19045, 4046], [10, 0, 10240, 20469], [10, 0, 22631, 3155], [10, 0, 22621, 3155], [10, 0, 22000, 2777], and [10, 0, 19044, 4046], with relevant KB Article IDs including KB-5034763.",
