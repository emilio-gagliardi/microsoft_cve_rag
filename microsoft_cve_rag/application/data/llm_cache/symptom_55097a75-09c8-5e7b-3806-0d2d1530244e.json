  "description": "Users may experience unexpected crashes or instability in Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) when using versions prior to 126.0.6478.54. This occurs due to a type confusion issue in the V8 engine, affecting how the browser handles certain web pages. Such behavior could lead to loss of user session and data, causing frustration and potential data loss for end users. The update outlined in KB-126.0.2592.56 aims to rectify this issue, and administrators should ensure that all users are updated to at least version 126.0.2592.56 to mitigate the impact of these crashes. Regular checks for browser updates are advisable for maintaining a stable and secure browsing environment for users.",
