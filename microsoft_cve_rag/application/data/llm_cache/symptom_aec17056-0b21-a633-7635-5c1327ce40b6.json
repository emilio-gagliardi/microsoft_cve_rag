  "description": "After installing security update KB-122.0.2365.80 for Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based), users may experience unexpected crashes of the browser. This issue appears to stem from an out-of-bounds memory access in the Chromium rendering engine, version 122.0.6261.111, which could disrupt daily browsing activities. Affected versions cause the browser to become unstable, resulting in loss of unsaved work and interrupted web sessions, significantly hampering productivity. Users are advised to check their current build version to confirm whether they are affected, and promptly update to a stable release to mitigate these crashing issues as part of their routine maintenance operations.",
