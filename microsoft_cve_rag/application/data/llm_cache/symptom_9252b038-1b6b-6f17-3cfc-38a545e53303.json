  "description": "After applying monthly operating system cumulative updates, a significant number of devices experience an inability to apply these updates, both manually and automatically. The issue appears to stem from hive level corruption that creates an infinite loop, preventing successful cumulative installs as referenced in KB5041580. While other updates such as Microsoft Defender and non-cumulative updates can be applied without issue, the cumulative OS updates remain problematic. An in-place repair using an appropriate ISO from Microsoft can potentially resolve this, allowing the latest cumulative update to be successfully applied. Additionally, upgrading to Windows 11 might be a viable workaround, and there are concerns regarding whether future cumulative updates for the new OS will apply correctly post-upgrade.",
