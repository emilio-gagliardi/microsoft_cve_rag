  "description": "An observable issue arises where several PCs fail to reduce the size of the C: partition effectively. This symptom seems to stem from the presence of files located at the end of the partition, which prevents the partition resizing process from completing successfully. The tools typically employed for this operation, namely diskpart.exe and diskmgmt.msc, only adjust the marker for the last block, without relocating any files situated in between. As a result, this limitation causes frustration among system administrators trying to reclaim disk space, thereby complicating maintenance efforts. Although the majority of systems do not experience this issue, the unsuccessful attempts to modify partition sizes can considerably hinder routine system management tasks.",
