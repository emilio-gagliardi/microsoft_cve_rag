  "description": "Windows Server 2022 instances are unexpectedly receiving and applying updates intended for Windows 2025 (version 24h2). This behavior suggests that the monthly cumulative update is misconfigured in the update deployment process, causing erroneous upgrade actions on the 2022 servers. End users and system administrators might face issues related to unintended feature changes or compatibility problems due to these upgrades. Regular monitoring and update validation are essential to prevent disruptions in production environments. Currently, there are no specific build numbers or KB article references to address this issue directly.",
