  "description": "The underlying cause of the issue is related to the outdated custom WinPE image that was not compatible with the current requirements of the mitigated device running Windows 11 24h2. The use of the 2024 version of Windows ADK was necessary to create an updated WinPE image that could successfully boot on the device. The dependency on the Endpoint Management software to provide an updated WinPE image contributed to the initial failure; hence, the process to manually use DISM to update the ISO was essential for resolving booting issues. Failing to utilize the latest Windows ADK tools may have resulted in incompatibility issues with the hardware or features required by the operating system. This situation underscores the importance of regularly updating deployment tools to maintain compatibility with new OS releases and mitigate boot issues effectively.",
