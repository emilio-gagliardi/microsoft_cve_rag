  "description": "End users may experience unexpected behaviors when attempting to perform administrative tasks within the Windows environment. Specifically, on affected builds including 10.0.19045.4291, users might notice that the Windows CSC service does not respond as expected, resulting in the ability for low-privileged users to elevate their privileges improperly. This could lead to unauthorized access to system resources or sensitive data, making it critical for system administrators to assess the deployment of updates KB-5036925, KB-5036894, KB-5036893, and KB-5036892 in their environments. System administrators should monitor user activity closely after applying the updates to ensure no escalation of privilege is observed. These symptoms could potentially disrupt workflow and compromise security across the affected systems.",
