  "description": "After applying the security updates outlined in KB5044284 and KB5044285 for Windows 11 versions 22H2, 23H2, and 24H2, users may observe unexpected behaviors including potential remote code execution capabilities being improperly engaged. This can manifest as unauthorized programs or commands executing on the system without the user's intent. Systems with build numbers 10.0.22621.4317, 10.0.22631.4317, and 10.0.26100.2033 are particularly at risk. The requirement for user interaction may lead to users inadvertently opening malicious files, causing their systems to exhibit behaviors where sensitive data could be compromised and integrity jeopardized. System administrators should remain vigilant for any unfamiliar activities post-update as these unexpected execution paths could significantly affect security posture.",
