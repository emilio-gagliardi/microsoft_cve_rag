  "description": "After applying the security update associated with KB5032199, users may observe that Windows Defender Smartscreen checks are being bypassed. This behavior is particularly concerning as it allows unverified applications to run without user prompts, undermining security protocols. This symptom can impact systems running on Windows 10 build numbers including 10.0.22631.2715, 10.0.19043.3693, and relevant versions from Windows Server, highlighting the need for immediate attention to maintain system integrity.",
