  "description": "The vulnerability in the win32k component arises from a use-after-free condition that allows an attacker to elevate privileges on the system. This occurs when the memory previously allocated is released, but still accessed or manipulated, leading to potential unauthorized control over system resources. The condition is exploitable locally, requiring basic user privileges, and results in significant confidentiality, integrity, and availability risks for the affected systems.",
