  "description": "The Microsoft Management Console contains a flaw in the handling of user-supplied input, leading to improper neutralization of special elements. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code locally after tricking a user into opening a malicious console file. This issue manifests in systems with specific build versions of Windows 10 and Windows 11, particularly where the console's execution capabilities can be exploited without the need for elevated privileges.",
