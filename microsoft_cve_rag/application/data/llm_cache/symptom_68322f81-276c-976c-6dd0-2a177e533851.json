  "description": "Users may experience failure to boot Linux when applying updates that implement secure boot advanced targeting (SBAT), particularly if utilizing older Linux distribution ISOs. This impacts systems where Windows and Linux are dual-booted, leading to the inability to load the Linux operating system after the security updates identified by KB5041571. Customers should review compatibility with their Linux vendors in case they need updated ISOs to maintain functionality. This symptom is particularly relevant for systems affected by the buffer overflow in the GRUB2 boot loader, which can result in a secure boot bypass if not appropriately addressed through updates.",
