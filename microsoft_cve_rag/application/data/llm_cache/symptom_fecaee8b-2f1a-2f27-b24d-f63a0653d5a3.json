  "description": "End users may experience unexpected changes in their user access levels, allowing certain users to obtain administrative privileges on affected Windows systems. This may manifest as unauthorized installations of software or alterations to system configurations that are beyond the typical user rights. The issue primarily affects Windows 11 versions 24H2, 23H2, and 22H2, as well as several Windows 10 builds. Users can reference KB Article IDs including KB-5044284 and KB-5044285 for further details and mitigation strategies. System administrators should remain vigilant for unusual activities or unauthorized changes that may indicate exploitation of this flaw.",
