  "description": "Users connecting to a malicious SQL database using the ODBC driver may experience unexpected application behavior as arbitrary code can be executed within the context of their SQL client application. This behavior typically emerges when an authenticated user is tricked into establishing a connection, resulting in unintended actions or data manipulation. End users may notice the application crashing, data corruption, or unusual prompts that disrupt their workflow. Specifically, this issue affects various Windows builds including 10.0.19045.4170, 10.0.10240.20526, and 10.0.22631.3296 as documented in KB articles KB-5035858 and KB-5035853. System administrators should monitor applications for unexpected behavior and potentially compromised environments as remediation efforts continue.",
