  "description": "Users may encounter an issue where they are unable to access their Windows installation on a Surface Pro due to the BitLocker encryption that is preventing boot up. If the BitLocker recovery key is not available or cannot be retrieved from the user's Microsoft account, they risk having to reinstall Windows, resulting in potential data loss for any files not backed up. This can occur particularly when users are unsure about the status of their Microsoft account or if the key was not saved beforehand. This symptom highlights the importance of securely storing the BitLocker recovery key to avoid issues during system access. Relevant guidance can be found in Microsoft's support documentation about locating the BitLocker recovery key.",
