  "description": "**Fix Overview**:\n\nTo successfully boot from a USB drive when using Windows PE, ensure the thumb drive is updated with the proper boot configuration before attempting to use it on devices with different mitigation states.\n\n1. From a device with the necessary mitigations installed, run the following commands to copy the boot configuration from the EFI directory:\n   ```\ncop d:\boot\boot\bcdef d:\boot\boot\bcdbak\nbcdboot c:\build /f uefi /s d:\bootex\ncopy d:\boot\boot\bcdbak d:\boot\boot\bcd\n```  \n2. Use the updated USB stick to boot only devices that also have the mitigations installed to avoid boot failures.\n\n**Details**:\n- It is advisable to maintain two separate USB drives: one configured for systems without mitigations and another for systems that have them, ensuring compatibility across devices.
