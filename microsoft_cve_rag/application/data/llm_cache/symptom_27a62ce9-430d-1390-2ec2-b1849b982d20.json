  "description": "A standalone PC is unable to access the Windows 11 ISO download page due to a message indicating that the device is managed by an organization. This behavior is commonly encountered in corporate environments where management policies restrict device configurations and access to certain features. The issue typically arises when users lack proper permissions, possibly due to Group Policy or Intune settings that tightly regulate device management capabilities. System administrators might need to check the organization's device compliance settings or access management policies to determine how the device is perceived as managed. This situation can significantly hinder the ability of users on standalone PCs to manually download necessary updates or ISOs, which can create delays in system upgrades or patch deployments.",
