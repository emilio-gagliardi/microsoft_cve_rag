  "description": "Users may experience unauthorized code execution when connecting to a malicious SQL database using their SQL client application. This occurs because the vulnerable Microsoft WDAC OLE DB provider for SQL Server allows attackers to exploit the system through specially crafted replies sent from the compromised server. Once the user is tricked into making the connection, their SQL client can execute arbitrary code within its context, posing a significant risk to affected environments. The affected products include various versions of Windows 10 and Windows Server as listed in KB-5034763, specifically in build numbers such as 10.0.22631.3155 and 10.0.19045.4046. Administrators can utilize KB-5034763 for further details on the impacted builds and suggested remediation steps.",
