  "description": "After applying the security updates referenced by KB5043080, KB5043076, KB5043067, and KB5043064 on affected Windows builds (including versions 10.0.19044.4894, 10.0.22000.3197, and 10.0.22631.4169), users may notice that certain applications or system services may experience inconsistent behavior, leading to stability issues. System administrators could observe unexpected increases in privileges for applications leading to potential disruptions in user sessions, which could manifest as unauthorized access messages, failed executions of applications, or abrupt service terminations. Additionally, there could be impacts on system responsiveness, potentially causing performance degradation when sensitive tasks are completed. Users completing sensitive workflows may encounter interruptions or loss of data if the system experiences unforeseen behaviors related to privilege enhancements granted by the exploitation of this flaw.",
