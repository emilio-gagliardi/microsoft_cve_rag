  "description": "**Tool Overview**:\n\nThe resource-based constrained delegation for Active Directory (AD) is an approach that allows a computer object to delegate its access to other resources based on fine-grained controls. This delegation is particularly useful in scenarios involving services that need to perform actions on behalf of users or other services. \n\n**Details**:\n1. Provides an opportunity to manage what resources an AD computer can access without giving away high-level privileges.\n2. Allows administrators to specify permissions based on specific services that need to be accessed.\n3. Empowers users to securely delegate access without compromising overall system security.\n4. Can be utilized in different security scenarios, particularly when specific services need to interact with various resources on behalf of users.\n5. Related documentation can provide further insights and practical examples of how to configure this delegation.\n\n**Reference Link**: For more detailed guidance, refer to the resource-linked documentation: [IRED Team - Active Directory Kerberos Abuse](https://www.ired.team/offensive-security-experiments/active-directory-kerberos-abuse/resource-based-constrained-delegation-ad-computer-object).",
