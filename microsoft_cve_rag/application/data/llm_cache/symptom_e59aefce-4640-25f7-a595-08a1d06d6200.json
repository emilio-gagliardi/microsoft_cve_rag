  "description": "After applying the security update KB-5036910 for Windows Server 2022 (23H2 edition, server core installation), users may experience an elevation of privilege issue. This behavior can manifest as unauthorized access to critical system resources or functions that were previously restricted. Administrators may notice that certain operations that demand high privilege levels can be executed without the usual authorization checks. This breach of access control can lead to significant security risks, where threats can manipulate system settings or access sensitive data. Regular application and monitoring of security patches are crucial to mitigate these risks and maintain secure operational integrity.",
