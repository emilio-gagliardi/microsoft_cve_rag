  "description": "Users may experience unexpected behavior or compromised functionality during the boot process of Lenovo preloaded Windows 7 and 8 operating systems from 2012 to 2014 due to a buffer overflow issue in the system recovery bootloader. This could lead to scenarios where the system allows unauthorized local access, enabling a privileged attacker to execute arbitrary code. The affected build numbers include [10, 0, 19045, 4291], [10, 0, 19044, 4291], [10, 0, 22631, 3447], [10, 0, 22000, 2899], and [10, 0, 22621, 3447]. Administrators and end-users should monitor for any unusual boot-related actions or prompts that suggest a breach of expected system integrity. Additionally, the issue is documented under KB Articles KB-5036896, KB-5036894, KB-5036893, and KB-5036892, indicating important updates are crucial to mitigate this risk.",
