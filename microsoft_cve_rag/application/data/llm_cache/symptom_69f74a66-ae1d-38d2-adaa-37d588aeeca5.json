  "description": "After applying the updates mentioned in KB-5036925, KB-5036894, KB-5036893, and KB-5036892, users may experience issues where the secure boot feature is bypassed on certain Windows builds. This could lead to unintended behaviors such as unauthorized access to system resources or reduced security posture. The affected Windows build versions include 10.0.19045.4291, 10.0.19044.4291, 10.0.22631.3447, 10.0.22000.2899, and 10.0.22621.3447, as well as older builds like 10.0.10240.20596. Administrators should be vigilant and monitor their systems for any signs of stability issues or unexpected behavior following the update installation. It is important to ensure that secure boot is enforced where applicable to mitigate potential risks associated with this behavior.",
