  "description": "The underlying cause for the ongoing necessity of security updates for Windows 10 past the end of support date of October 14, 2025, is tied to the critical vulnerabilities that may be present in the operating system. Although Windows 10 will not receive regular updates after this date, the Extended Security Updates (ESU) program allows organizations and individual consumers to continue receiving essential security updates through a paid subscription. This situation arises from the risks associated with using unsupported software, which can expose systems to potential exploits. Additionally, the ESU program is a response to the need for extended support for users who may not be able to transition to newer versions of Windows promptly. The lack of updates creates a significant security gap that the ESU program aims to bridge until users fully migrate to a supported operating system like Windows 11.",
