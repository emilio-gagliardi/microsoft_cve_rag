  "description": "The underlying issue stems from a bug in the Azure Stack that causes virtual machines to fail upon startup after installing the October 2023 cumulative update (CU). This issue is specifically noted in the Microsoft tech community, where it acknowledges the installation of the CU as the trigger for the failure. Although no specific CVE IDs are mentioned, the context suggests that existing configurations may interact poorly with the update, leading to failed VM boot processes. The root cause may involve how the CU alters system files or dependencies that are critical for virtual machine operations. Administrators should refer to KB Article 3956844 for further details and potential mitigation strategies.",
