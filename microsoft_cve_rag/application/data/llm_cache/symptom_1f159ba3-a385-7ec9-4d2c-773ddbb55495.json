  "symptom_label": "LinuxKernelLimitedToEightCoresForYears",
  "description": "The Linux kernel has been inadvertently hardcoded to support a maximum of eight cores since a 2009 commit, which constrained performance for applications requiring more processing power. This limitation affects various Linux distributions leveraging the kernel, particularly in enterprise environments where multi-core processing is essential for scaling applications and handling workloads efficiently. The issue may lead to suboptimal performance and could hinder the deployment of modern applications designed to utilize more cores effectively.",
