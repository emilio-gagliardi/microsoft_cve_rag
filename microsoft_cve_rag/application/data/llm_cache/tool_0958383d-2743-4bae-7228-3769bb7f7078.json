  "description": "**Tool Overview**:\n\nThis tool is intended to assist system administrators in mitigating the information disclosure vulnerability associated with Windows Cryptographic Services (CVE-2024-21311). **Details**:\n\nThis tool provides actionable steps that administrators can take to address the vulnerabilities in the cryptographic services provided by Windows 10 and 11. In particular, it offers guidelines for securing systems against unauthorized access through read, write, and execute capabilities. Here's how it helps:\n1. **Local and Remote Access Control**: Ensures that the systems are configured to limit local and remote access, reducing the risk of exploitation by unauthorized users.\n2. **User Interaction Mitigation**: Provides recommendations for user education to minimize the risk of an attacker tricking legitimate users into executing harmful actions.\n3. **Complexity Reduction**: Guides the configuration that lowers the conditions necessary for exploitation, thereby improving overall security posture.\n\nFor a full account of how to apply these mitigation strategies, including detailed instructions and additional resources, please refer to the associated Fix description.",
