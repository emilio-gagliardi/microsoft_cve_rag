  "description": "**Tool Overview**:\n\nThe PowerShell script addresses the elevation of privilege vulnerability identified as CVE-2024-38033. This vulnerability arises from improper input validation, allowing an attacker to gain higher access privileges than intended. **Usage Details**:\n\nTo mitigate this issue, administrators should utilize PowerShell to assess configurations and permissions that may be susceptible. A sample command could include checking for altered user permissions or configurations that exploit this vulnerability. The effectiveness of this script lies in its ability to promptly identify potentially vulnerable configurations and rectify any discrepancies to prevent unauthorized access.\n\n**Example Command**:\n```powershell\n# Example of checking for user permissions\nGet-LocalUser | Where-Object { $_.Enabled -eq $true }\n```\nThis command will list all enabled local user accounts, allowing administrators to ascertain who has elevated privileges.",
