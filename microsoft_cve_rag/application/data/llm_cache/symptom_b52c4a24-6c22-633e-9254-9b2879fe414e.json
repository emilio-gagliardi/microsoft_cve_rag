  "symptom_label": "radius_protocol_spoofing_causes_access_modification",
  "description": "The exploitation of the radius protocol vulnerability can result in unauthorized modifications to access responses, impacting system authentication processes. End users may experience unexpected authorization behaviors, such as the granting of access when it should have been denied, or vice versa. This could lead to significant security risks, as users may gain inappropriate access to resources. For systems operating on Windows 10 build numbers 19045.4651 and 19044.4651, as well as Windows 11 builds 22631.3880 and 22000.3079, these symptoms could manifest after updating to relevant patches KB5040442, KB5040431, or KB5040427. Consequently, system administrators should monitor authentication logs closely following the installation of these updates to detect any anomalies related to access permissions.",
