  "description": "Users of M365 Copilot have reported an inability to see the application after installation. This issue may arise for users who are on the Copilot Pro version but still do not have access to the features expected. There seems to be a lack of definitive documentation provided for the application, which complicates troubleshooting efforts. Furthermore, there is confusion due to the absence of version numbers on the support page, making it difficult for administrators to verify the installation's success and to understand which features should be available. This lack of visibility into M365 Copilot could significantly impede user productivity and hinder the expected deployment of newly introduced functionalities.",
