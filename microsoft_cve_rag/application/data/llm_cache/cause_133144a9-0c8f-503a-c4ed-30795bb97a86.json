  "description": "The underlying cause highlighted in this post concerns the need to correctly interpret the exit codes generated by the Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT). In many enterprise environments, misinterpreting or overlooking these exit codes can lead to confusion about the execution status and effectiveness of the tool. The specific reference to the exit codes in KB Article KB-891716 emphasizes this point. Administrators must be aware of these codes to assess whether the tool ran successfully or encountered issues during execution. Failure to check these exit codes may result in undetected malware presence or inefficient remediation efforts.",
