  "description": "After the installation of the provided security updates (KB-5036894, KB-5036892, and related articles), users may experience issues where their systems fail to start properly due to the secure boot feature being compromised. This behavior can manifest as continuous boot loops or error messages indicating that the operating system cannot be loaded. Specific builds like 10.0.19045.4291, 10.0.22000.2899, and others listed under the affected versions may see this observable symptom, which could impact overall system functionality. The inability to successfully boot into the operating system not only affects end users' productivity but may also require additional troubleshooting steps or recovery procedures. System administrators should be aware of this symptom when deploying these updates to ensure smooth system operation post-installation.",
