  "description": "The primary cause identified in this post is the Microsoft Exchange Server Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability (CVE-2024-21410) and the Microsoft Outlook Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2024-21413). These vulnerabilities allow unauthenticated attackers to exploit the systems, with CVE-2024-21410 enabling them to relay NTLM credentials and impersonate users, while CVE-2024-21413 permits bypassing Office's Protected View setting to execute malicious code. Both vulnerabilities carry a high CVSS rating of 9.8, indicating their critical nature and the importance of immediate action. Patching is complicated as it necessitates the installation of the Exchange Server 2019 Cumulative Update 14 (CU14) and enabling the Extended Protection for Authentication (EPA) feature. Additionally, for the Office 2016 users, multiple updates are required to address these issues effectively, emphasizing the complexity of maintaining security for Microsoft products.",
