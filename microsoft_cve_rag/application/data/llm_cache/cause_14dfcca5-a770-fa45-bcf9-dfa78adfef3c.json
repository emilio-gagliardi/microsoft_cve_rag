  "description": "The underlying cause of the authentication denial issues post the October 2023 updates is the removal of support for the registry subkey 'krbtgtfullpacsignature' and the discontinuation of audit mode. As of the updates released on or after October 10, 2023, the Windows operating system enforces compliance with the new PAC signatures for service tickets. This means that any previously set configurations in the registry to manage PAC signatures are ignored, leading to failed authentication attempts for service tickets that do not meet the new compliance standards. The lack of backward compatibility creates significant operational disruptions, particularly for services relying on the outdated registry entries, resulting in a critical need for system administrators to review and update their configurations to align with the latest patch requirements.",
