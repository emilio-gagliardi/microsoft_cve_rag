  "description": "Users are experiencing boot failures when attempting to start devices using bootable media constructed with the 10.1.26100.1 ADK. The failure occurs after applying mitigation steps outlined in KB5025885, especially in relation to secure boot configuration. The issue is tied to the misalignment between the expected secure boot signatures and the actual signatures present on the bootable media. In particular, media that is not signed with the 2023 certificate authority (CA) is being rejected by the system during the boot process. This can prevent both virtual and physical machines from properly initiating deployments, creating significant challenges for system administrators responsible for imaging and deployment tasks.",
