  "description": "**Tool Overview**:\n\nThis tool represents the automatic updates for Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) which include patches and fixes for vulnerabilities like CVE-2024-1674. Microsoft Edge continually integrates updates from the Chromium project to address various security issues and enhance overall browser performance. \n\n**Details**:\n\n1. Microsoft Edge utilizes an automatic update mechanism that regularly collects and installs updates, ensuring users have the latest security features.\n2. When updates are available, users may see notifications or updates applied silently in the background, enhancing browser security without user intervention.\n3. Reviewing the Google Chrome releases also provides insight into the updates that apply to Microsoft Edge, as both share the Chromium base.\n4. Users can manually check for updates within the Edge browser settings under 'Help and feedback' -> 'About Microsoft Edge' which will also trigger a search for the latest available version.\n5. For more comprehensive management, enterprise administrators can leverage Group Policies to configure update settings for Microsoft Edge installations across an organization.",
