  "description": "An observable behavior where the Windows operating system needs an increased size of the recovery image can lead to operational discrepancies. This can manifest especially during system updates, where the update process fails or is interrupted due to insufficient space in the recovery tools partition. Ensuring that the recovery tools partition is positioned immediately after the Windows partition allows for modifications and resizing, as future updates may necessitate a larger recovery image to accommodate new features or enhancements.",
