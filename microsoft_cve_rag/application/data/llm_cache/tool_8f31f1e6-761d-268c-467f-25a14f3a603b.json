  "description": "A process for detecting the installation of Acrobat and Acrobat Reader based on the presence of specific executable files in designated directories. The method involves checking for the existence of 'acrobat.exe' in 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Adobe' or 'C:\\Program Files\\Adobe'. If 'acrobat.exe' is found alongside 'acrord32.exe', then both programs are installed; if 'acrord32.exe' is found in a different directory without 'acrobat.exe', only Acrobat Reader is installed. This method aids in managing and configuring patch deployment for Adobe applications (LLM Synthesized).",
