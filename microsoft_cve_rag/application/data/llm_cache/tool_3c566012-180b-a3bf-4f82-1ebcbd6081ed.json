  "description": "**Tool Overview**:\n\nThis resource provides instructions on disabling Copilot and blocking ChatGPT in Windows and Microsoft Edge using Group Policy and Defender.\n\n**Details**:\n\nThe article outlines steps that can be followed either locally on individual machines or through Group Policy Objects (GPO) for broader applications across an organization. It highlights that there are potentially three Copilot engines present in Windows 10 and 11, depending on the OS version and the installed version of Microsoft Edge. These include the standalone application, a module integrated into Windows Search, and a specific Bing Chat/Copilot module within the Microsoft Edge sidebar. To effectively utilize this tool, administrators must ensure they have the correct Microsoft 365 licensing, such as E3, E5, A3, Business Standard, or Business Premium, to manage user access accordingly. \n\n**Usage**: \n1. Follow the guidelines to modify local settings or implement GPOs.\n2. Verify the Windows and Edge version present in your environment to apply the appropriate method.\n3. Ensure that necessary administrative templates are available to implement the changes effectively.",
