  "description": "The underlying cause of the issue stems from the implementation of a state machine for managing task sequences in PowerShell. This approach relies on specific registry keys, such as '$runOnce' located at 'HKLM:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\RunOnce' and '$doneKey' at 'HKLM:\\Software\\SmithConsulting'. By storing command execution states in these keys and utilizing a switch statement to manage the transition of state values, the solution effectively handles script execution order. The complexity of the task sequence can accumulate significantly due to the number of lines of PowerShell code required for implementation. This method is influenced by potential misconfigurations in registry handling, which may lead to improper execution of the planned tasks, as observed during client project deployments. The solution references CVEs CVE-2023-24932 and CVE-2024-28921 as part of the context, hinting at broader implications for patch management strategies.",
