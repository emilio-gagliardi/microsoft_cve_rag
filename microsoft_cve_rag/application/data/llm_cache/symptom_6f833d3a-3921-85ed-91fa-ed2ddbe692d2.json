  "description": "Systems using Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) version 126.0.2592.68 and earlier may experience instability or unexpected behavior when a user interacts with maliciously crafted files. These interactions could potentially expose the user to remote code execution risks, which could result in unauthorized code being executed within the context of the affected user's session. Moreover, users may notice enhanced system resource consumption or unresponsiveness in the browser following attempted exploitation. As a direct consequence, users are urged to upgrade to the fixed version 126.0.2592.81 or newer to mitigate these risks effectively, as outlined in KB34122 and the associated metadata.",
