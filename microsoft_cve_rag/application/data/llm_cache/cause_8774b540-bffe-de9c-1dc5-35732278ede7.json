  "description": "The Windows Distributed File System (DFS) has an improper restriction of names for files and other resources that enables remote code execution. The vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system, provided they have low privileges and are on the same network segment as the target. This situation arises due to inadequate controls on input for DFS namespace paths, resulting in a failure to validate or restrict the processing of certain resource names, thereby allowing malicious exploitation of the system.",
