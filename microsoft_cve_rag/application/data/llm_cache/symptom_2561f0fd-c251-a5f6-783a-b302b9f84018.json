  "description": "In systems running Windows 11 and Windows 10, administrators may observe the inability to restrict unauthorized access after certain updates lead to an elevation of privilege scenario. Users with malicious intent might gain higher-level administrative rights, potentially leading to unauthorized changes in system configurations or access to sensitive data. Notably, after applying security updates referenced in KB-5043080, KB-5043076, KB-5043064, and KB-5043067, administrators need to test and validate user access controls, particularly in environments running affected build numbers such as 10.0.26100.1742 or 10.0.19044.4894. Consequently, end users interacting with these systems might experience unexpected behavior or access to resources beyond their intended privileges, thereby increasing the risk to system integrity from unauthorized modifications.",
