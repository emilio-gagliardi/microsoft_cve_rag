  "symptom_label": "windows_11_fails_to_detect_headphones_properly",
  "description": "Users are experiencing an issue with Windows 11 where the operating system fails to detect headphones when they are plugged in. The volume slider presents only a single output choice labeled 'speakers / headphones', without differentiating between the two. This indicates that the system is not recognizing the headphones as a separate audio output device, which is essential for active selection by the user. Users reported that absolutely nothing occurs upon connecting the headphones, highlighting a failure in the automatic detection functionality. This problem can hinder normal user experience for audio output on Windows 11 systems.",
