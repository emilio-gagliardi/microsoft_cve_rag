  "description": "A problem has been identified with BitLocker-encrypted removable drives after the installation of the August 2024 updates. Users are encountering an error code (0x8031009b), stating that 'the management information stored on the drive contained an unknown type.' This issue has been reported specifically on Windows Server systems, where access to these drives becomes problematic, while they work correctly on Windows 10 and 11 Pro. Users find that the affected drives can be unlocked using a password, but not through any of the other key protectors. Uninstalling the August updates restores normal functionality, allowing the drives to appear correctly with automatic unlock enabled. This inconsistency suggests a potential flaw introduced in the recent Windows Server update affecting the BitLocker management of encrypted drives.",
