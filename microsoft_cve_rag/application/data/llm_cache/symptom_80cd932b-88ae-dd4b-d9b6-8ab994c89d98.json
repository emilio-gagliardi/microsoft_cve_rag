  "symptom_label": "peculiar_boot_delay_with_national_instruments_drivers",
  "description": "The installation of National Instruments DAQmx drivers may lead to a peculiar boot delay problem observed in Windows systems, specifically when operating on builds 22H2 or 23H2. This issue has been attributed to the update referenced in KB5040442. Administrators may notice extended boot times, which can hinder productivity and cause frustration among users, especially in environments reliant on timely system accessibility. The anomaly could affect various editions of the operating system, prompting administrators to consider reviewing their deployment strategies to mitigate the impact of this symptom. Solutions should include monitoring for updates from Microsoft and evaluating the compatibility of drivers with system builds to prevent such delays.",
