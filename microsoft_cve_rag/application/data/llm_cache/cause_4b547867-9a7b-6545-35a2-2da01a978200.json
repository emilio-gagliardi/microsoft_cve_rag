  "description": "The underlying issue was that the Remote Desktop Gateway Service would stop responding when a service utilized remote procedure calls (RPC) over HTTP. This misbehavior led to client disconnections, significantly impacting user experience and operational continuity. The security update identified in KB-5044284, which incorporates fixes from the earlier update KB-5043178, addresses this critical problem to restore functionality. It's pertinent for administrators to ensure that their systems are updated to prevent service disruptions. This addresses a key service reliability concern for users relying on remote access tools.",
