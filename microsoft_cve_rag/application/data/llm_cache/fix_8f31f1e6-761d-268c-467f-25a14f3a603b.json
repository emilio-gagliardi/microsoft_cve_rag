  "description": "To accurately detect whether Adobe Acrobat or Acrobat Reader is installed on a system, you can check the presence of specific executable files. Look for 'acrobat.exe' in the directories 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Adobe' or 'C:\\Program Files\\Adobe'. If 'acrobat.exe' is found in conjunction with 'acrord32.exe', both applications are installed. If 'acrord32.exe' is present without 'acrobat.exe', only Acrobat Reader is installed. For enhanced detection capabilities, perform a search for all folders containing 'acrord32.exe' to determine the presence of both applications accurately.",
