  "description": "The underlying cause of the issue stems from the requirement for ESXi hosts to be running on version 8 in order to avoid penalties or operational failures after the installation of the 10-2023 cumulative update (CU). Failure to comply with this versioning requirement can result in unsuccessful attempts to start virtual machines, as indicated by the links associated with the Microsoft Azure Stack discussion. This reflects a potential oversight in version compatibility that could directly affect the uptime and operational reliability of virtual environments leveraging Hyper-V technologies. The connection to VMware underscores the importance of ensuring that all related virtualization products are at compatible build numbers to prevent adverse effects. Ensuring that hosts are updated to meet this version criterion is essential for maintaining overall system performance and stability.",
