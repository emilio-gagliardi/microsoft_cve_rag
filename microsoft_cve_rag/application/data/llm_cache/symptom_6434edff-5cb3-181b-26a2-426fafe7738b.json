  "description": "After the application of security update KB-127.0.2651.105 for Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based), users may experience unexpected behavior due to elevated privileges being gained by malicious applications. This could manifest as unanticipated input being accepted from applications that should be restricted, leading to a potential compromise of sensitive data or modification of settings without user consent. In some cases, users might notice that certain actions which were previously restricted are now permitted, resulting in system changes that are inconsistent with user permissions. Due to the nature of the vulnerability classified under CVE-2024-43472, this symptom emphasizes the importance of monitoring system behaviors closely after updates are installed, particularly on build version 127.0.2651.105 and related editions.",
