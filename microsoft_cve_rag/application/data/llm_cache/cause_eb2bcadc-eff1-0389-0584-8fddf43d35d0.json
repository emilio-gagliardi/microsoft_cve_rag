  "description": "The underlying cause of the issue is linked to the recent update documented in KB-5034441, which has unexpectedly removed Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) as a distribution method for Windows 10 version 21H2 and 22H2. This change can disrupt the normal deployment of updates across an enterprise, leading to potential patch management challenges. Specifically, the quiet updating of distribution methods without prior notification increases the risk of installation failures. The removal may also require system administrators to reassess their update distribution strategies to ensure compliance and security. As a result, organizations may face difficulties in managing updates efficiently, necessitating immediate action to accommodate the change introduced by the update.",
