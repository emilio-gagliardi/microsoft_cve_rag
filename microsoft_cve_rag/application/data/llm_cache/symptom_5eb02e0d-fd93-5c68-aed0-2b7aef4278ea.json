  "description": "End users may experience system instability when using Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) version 128.0.2739.79, particularly when navigating to certain HTML pages that could trigger a heap buffer overflow. Users might notice unexpected crashes or application freezes, making it difficult to continue their browsing session. This instability is a result of vulnerability CVE-2024-8636 identified in the graphics rendering component Skia, impacting the user experience severely by causing data loss during usage. To mitigate this issue, users are advised to update to the latest version of Microsoft Edge that addresses the heap corruption concerns immediate, specifically version 128.0.6613.137 or higher, as outlined in KB Articles for security updates.",
