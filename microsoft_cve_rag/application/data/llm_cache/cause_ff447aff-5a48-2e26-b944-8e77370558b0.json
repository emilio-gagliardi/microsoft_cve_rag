  "description": "The cause of the memory leak in the LSASS process is attributed to specific issues arising from the recent security updates released in March 2024, referenced in KB4088764. This memory leak has implications for Active Directory Domain Controllers (DCs), particularly affecting the availability of the LSASS process which is crucial for authentication and authorization in Windows environments. The leaks could result in elevated memory usage, potentially leading to server performance degradation or even crashes if left unaddressed. Administrators should consider monitoring memory usage and applying related KB updates to mitigate this risk effectively. The detailed reporting highlights the urgency of investigating any unusual memory patterns post-update.",
