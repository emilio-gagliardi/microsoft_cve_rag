  "description": "To address the annoyance previously encountered with the Windows 2022 VM template, it is recommended to install the latest cumulative update (CU), specifically the November CU. This action appears to effectively resolve the issue without reintroducing the problematic behavior that was uninstalled earlier. The cumulative update contains various enhancements and bug fixes that contribute to system stability and performance. It's crucial for system administrators to maintain up-to-date templates to ensure consistent deployments and minimize complications. Monitoring subsequent CUs and their effects on templates is essential for maintaining an efficient infrastructure.",
