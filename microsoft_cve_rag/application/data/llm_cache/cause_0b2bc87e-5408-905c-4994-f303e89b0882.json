  "description": "The underlying cause of the remote code execution is a use-after-free error in Microsoft Office components, allowing an attacker to manipulate memory after it has been freed, which they can exploit by convincing a user to open a malicious document locally. This affects Microsoft 365 apps for both 32-bit and 64-bit systems and requires user interaction for exploitation.",
