  "description": "Users have reported issues with Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE) prompting for BitLocker recovery keys from external USB devices instead of utilizing the keys stored in Active Directory. This behavior can complicate recovery attempts, especially when users are unaware of the need to have their BitLocker keys on hand. Problems often arise when the user attempts to boot into recovery mode, which may not function correctly if the required key is not provided. This symptom affects Windows 10 and Windows 11 systems where the backup is conducted using a BitLocker encrypted drive. If the computer fails to boot into recovery, it is suggested to use a Windows installation medium to access recovery options directly.",
