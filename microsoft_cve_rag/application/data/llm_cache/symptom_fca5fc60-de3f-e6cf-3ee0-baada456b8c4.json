  "description": "After the installation of security updates referenced in KB5046613, KB5046617, and KB5046696, users may experience errors related to unauthorized actions being attempted on their systems. Specifically, systems running Windows 10 versions 21H2 and 22H2, as well as Windows 11 version 24H2, may display unexpected prompts or block legitimate actions that require elevated privileges. Users might notice that certain applications are unable to run or perform tasks promptly, resulting in a disrupted workflow. Additionally, errors could manifest when trying to modify system settings or access secure resources. This behavior points to an underlying issue that impacts the execution and control of user sessions on affected devices, recorded in builds 10.0.19044.5131 and 10.0.26100.2314.",
