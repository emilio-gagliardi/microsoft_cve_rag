  "description": "**Tool Overview**:\n\nThis tool provides a method to configure the Microsoft Connected Cache (MCC) endpoint in enterprise environments, particularly useful for organizations facing issues with update downloads after recent Windows security updates.\n\n**Details**:\n1. The primary action involves setting the Microsoft Connected Cache endpoint in the `docachehost` policy as specified in the cache hostname.\n2. Additionally, it's crucial to either set `docachehostsource` to 1 or remove it, as indicated in the cache hostname source guidelines. \n3. By default, both `docachehost` and `docachehostsource` policies start with no value, so modifications must be made accordingly.\n4. This configuration helps ensure Windows devices utilize MCC nodes effectively, reducing unnecessary download traffic from the public internet.\n5. Organizations are encouraged to implement this during DHCP option 235 configurations to mitigate issues arising post-update.\n\n",
