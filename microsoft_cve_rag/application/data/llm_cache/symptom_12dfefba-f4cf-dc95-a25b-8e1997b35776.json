  "description": "System administrators may encounter an issue when attempting to upgrade to version 23.9.10 of ScreenConnect if a current active license is not recognized. After confirming the license is active, users experience an error stating their license has been revoked due to 'otherlegal' reasons, which affects upgrade reliability. This problem prevents users running unsupported versions, specifically older than 22.8, from moving to the latest version. Additionally, the upgrade process requires prior versions to have a compliant license for smooth transitions, leading to frustration for administrators who maintain their licenses for extended periods. These challenges create a lack of clarity regarding eligibility and upgrade capabilities, complicating license management.",
