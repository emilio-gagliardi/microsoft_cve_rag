  "description": "After updating to the latest version of Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) 126.0.2592.113, end users may notice compatibility issues with some web applications or sites. This can manifest as unexpected behavior such as elements not rendering correctly, scripts failing to execute, or certain functionalities being unresponsive. Users might observe that while the browser is no longer vulnerable due to the recent security update (KB-126.0.2592.113), it may not perform as optimally as the previous versions when interfacing with specific websites. Such compatibility problems can lead to frustration among users who rely on those web applications for day-to-day tasks.",
