  "description": "The underlying cause of the installation errors when performing in-place upgrades appears to be linked to improper setup parameters and disk image mounting processes. Users have reported that without correctly specifying the drive letter and ensuring the dynamic update checks are in place, the upgrade may fail. Specifically, complications arise during the execution of automated scripts if power shell commands are not configured accurately to find the disk image and drive letter. The use of scripts from RMM (Remote Monitoring and Management) frameworks without validation could lead to inconsistencies that hinder the proper execution of the upgrade process. Ensuring all script parameters match the environment becomes critical, especially when using tools like 'mount-diskimage' and 'setup.exe'.",
