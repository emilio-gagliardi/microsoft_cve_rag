  "description": "Users may experience unauthorized access to system privileges when exploiting a vulnerability in the Windows Resource Manager. This elevation of privilege can result in unexpected system behavior, such as increased permissions for unauthorized tasks, potentially leading to data breaches or manipulation. It affects multiple Windows 10 and 11 builds including 10.0.19045.4780 for version 22H2, as well as 10.0.26100.1457 for version 24H2. The issue is documented under KB articles KB5041571, KB5041585, and KB5041580, which provide further details and updates necessary to mitigate this risk. Users are advised to apply the relevant updates to protect their systems from potential exploitation.",
