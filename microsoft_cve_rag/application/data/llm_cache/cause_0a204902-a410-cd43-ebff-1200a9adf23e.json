  "description": "The underlying issue is the improper input validation in the Windows Common Log File System Driver, allowing local attackers to elevate privileges by exploiting the vulnerability through read/write/execute capabilities. This occurs in environments where user interaction or specific configurations are not needed, potentially leading to a total loss of confidentiality and integrity for affected systems.",
