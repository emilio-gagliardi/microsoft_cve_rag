  "description": "When attempting to download and install the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) using PowerShell, users may encounter an 'Access is denied' message. This symptom indicates a permissions-related issue, which can prevent the successful execution of scripts intended for software installation. The observed behavior can emerge during the script execution, suggesting that the account being used lacks the necessary rights to perform web requests or write to the installation directory. System administrators should verify user access rights and administrative privileges in the Windows environment to troubleshoot this problem effectively. This symptom may affect systems running JRE installations via PowerShell scripts and is crucial for ensuring proper software deployment.",
