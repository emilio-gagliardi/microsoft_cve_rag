  "description": "**Tool Overview**:\n\nUsing multiple browser profiles allows users to log into multiple (or the same) M365 tenants simultaneously with different accounts.\n\n**Details**:\n1. This feature is useful for administrators managing multiple M365 tenants, as they can easily switch between accounts without the need to log out and back in.\n2. Each browser profile maintains its independent session, which means cookies, cache, and local storage are not shared across profiles.\n3. Browsers like Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge offer built-in functionality to create and manage multiple profiles, making it accessible for users.\n4. Administrators can customize each profile with different settings, extensions, and bookmarks according to their specific needs.\n5. This approach enhances productivity and efficiency when accessing various accounts simultaneously.\n\n",
