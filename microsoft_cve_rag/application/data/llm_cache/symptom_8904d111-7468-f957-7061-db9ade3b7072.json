  "description": "After deploying the updates KB-5041592, KB-5041585, KB-5041580, and KB-5041571, systems running Windows 10 versions 21H2 (build 19044.4780) and 22H2 (build 19045.4780), as well as Windows 11 version 24H2, may exhibit a troubling observable behavior. Specifically, there is a potential risk of kernel memory leaking sensitive information back to an attacker under certain conditions. This could lead to the unintentional disclosure of restricted system resources and user data, which poses a significant threat to system integrity and confidentiality. System administrators should be vigilant about monitoring their environments for any anomalies that could indicate such disclosures as users may not be fully aware of this background risk. Moreover, the leak is serious enough to necessitate immediate installation of the aforementioned patches to mitigate the threat effectively.",
