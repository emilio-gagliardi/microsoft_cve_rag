  "description": "Multiple Windows products, including Windows 10 (build numbers 10.0.19045.3570, 10.0.22000.2538, 10.0.17763.4974), and Windows Server versions, experience a denial of service due to the HTTP/2 rapid reset issue detailed in KB articles KB5031356, KB5031354, and KB5031358. Users may observe system unavailability or difficulty in establishing network connections, effectively rendering affected systems unable to respond to HTTP requests. Microsoft advises applying the available security updates promptly to mitigate this impact on performance and availability.",
