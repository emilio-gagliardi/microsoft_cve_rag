  "description": "Users on affected Windows systems may experience unauthorized access to system privileges as a direct consequence of the underlying issue associated with CVE-2024-21309. This security update addresses an elevation of privilege vulnerability within Windows kernel-mode driver components specifically targeting Windows 11 for x64-based systems (builds 10.0.22631.3007, 10.0.22621.3007, and 10.0.22000.2713), as detailed in KB5034123 and KB5034121. The observable behavior may lead to scenarios where unauthorized users gain undue access, possibly allowing them to make changes to system settings or sensitive files without being properly authenticated. Additionally, end users on Windows Server 2022 may notice similar impacts under build 10.0.25398.643, as mentioned in KB5034130. Consequently, ensuring that users apply the latest security patches is crucial to mitigate these vulnerabilities and maintain system security.",
