  "description": "Users may experience interruptions in performance when using Microsoft Visual Studio due to the elevation of privilege vulnerability identified as CVE-2024-29060. This impacts multiple versions, including Visual Studio 2022 (versions 17.4, 17.6, 17.8), Visual Studio 2019 (version 16.11), and Visual Studio 2017 (version 15.9). After the exploitation of this vulnerability, users could face scenarios where resource availability is reduced or performance is intermittently affected, though a complete denial of service is not achievable by the attacker. Additionally, this issue necessitates user interaction, as the attacker may create a malicious extension that could affect projects created by the user, thus potentially leading to elevated privileges being gained by unauthorized parties. This makes the issue critical for administrators to address promptly, particularly through the application of the relevant security updates (KB-16.11.37).",
