  "description": "After the installation of the March 2024 security update, local security authority subsystem service (LSASS) may develop a memory leak when handling Kerberos authentication requests on domain controllers. This affects only organizational environments utilizing Windows Server platforms, specifically Windows Server 2022, 2016, and 2012 R2. The leak can lead to extreme memory usage, causing LSASS to become unresponsive or crash, which results in unwanted reboots of the domain controllers. This issue is documented in several resolved KB articles (KB-5037426, KB-5037423, KB-5037422, KB-5035885, KB-5035857, and KB-5035855), and users are advised to avoid applying the March 2024 updates for domain controllers and utilize the provided out-of-band updates instead.",
