  "description": "The issue relates to the inability to boot from the Windows 2019 install ISO available through the Microsoft Volume Licensing site, which has not been updated since November 2022. While improvements have been made in secure boot vulnerability mitigations in the July cumulative update, the outdated ISO causes compatibility issues with newer server build VM templates. This lack of an updated ISO prevents administrators from properly deploying environments that rely on the Windows 2019 version setup, posing challenges for system updates and secure boot configurations.",
