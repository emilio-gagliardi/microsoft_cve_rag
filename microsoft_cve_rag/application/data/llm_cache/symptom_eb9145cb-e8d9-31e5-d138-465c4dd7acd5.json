  "description": "Due to an elevation of privilege vulnerability in the kernel streaming WOW Thunk service driver, users may experience misuse of system privileges. This issue can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive resources across the affected Windows builds, including versions 10.0.22631.3880, 10.0.22621.3880, and 10.0.19045.4651, among others. End users might observe unusual behavior, such as applications performing actions without consent, or access to configurations that should normally be restricted. This vulnerability impacts the integrity and confidentiality of user settings, which may manifest through unexpected modifications to user accounts or system settings, making it vital for administrators to apply the updates provided in KB5040442, KB5040431, and KB5040427 to mitigate such risks. Vigilance during user interactions with the system is advised, given this exploit could be executed locally or through social engineering tactics.",
