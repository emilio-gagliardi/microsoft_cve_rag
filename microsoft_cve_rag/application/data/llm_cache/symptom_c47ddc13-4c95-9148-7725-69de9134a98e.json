  "description": "Upon the exploitation of a trusted compute base elevation of privilege vulnerability, users may experience unauthorized access to system-level controls that should be reserved for administrators. This could allow an attacker to effectively elevate their privileges, subsequently modifying system settings, accessing sensitive files, or influencing system operations without proper authorization. Observably, affected systems displaying this behavior might show unexpected changes in permissions or erroneous access to files that are otherwise restricted. This symptom is especially concerning in environments where critical systems are involved, as it poses significant risks to both security and integrity. The impact is noted across various Windows versions including Windows 10 (builds 10.0.19045.4046, 10.0.19044.4046), and Windows 11 (builds 10.0.22631.3155, 10.0.22621.3155) as documented in KB5034765 and KB5034763.",
