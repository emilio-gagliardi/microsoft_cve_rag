  "description": "Users of Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) version 129.0.2792.52 and 129.0.6668.58 may experience unauthorized remote code execution if they click on a maliciously crafted link. This behavior is observable when an attacker successfully exploits this condition, as they gain control of the renderer process following user interaction. Importantly, the underlying problem arises due to the nature of the attack vector being network-based, combining with the requirement for user action to trigger the exploit. End users may notice unusual activity, unauthorized actions on their system, or instability as a result of this exploitation. The relevant KB Article for this update is KB43489, providing more context on the issue and required remediation steps.",
