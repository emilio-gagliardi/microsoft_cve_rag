  "description": "After applying the Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) security update 128.0.2739.79, users experience crashes when attempting to load certain webpages that utilize media router features. This issue can lead to frustration as it interrupts normal browsing activities. Additionally, users may notice unexpected behavior, such as the browser freezing and becoming unresponsive, particularly when interacting with media content. These symptoms can be particularly prevalent for those using older builds prior to the latest update. It is important for system administrators to inform users of potential instability in Edge following the update, especially if they heavily rely on web-based media applications.",
