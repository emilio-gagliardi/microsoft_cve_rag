  "description": "End users may experience unauthorized access to sensitive resources on Windows 11 systems due to an elevation of privilege issue. As a result, users could observe unanticipated behavior, such as being unable to access certain files, or potentially noticing data integrity issues where files have been modified unexpectedly. This behavior is especially concerning for systems running Windows 11 version 23H2 (build 10.0.22631.4037) and prior versions listed in KB articles such as KB5041585 and others. Administrators should be vigilant as these symptoms could indicate that malicious activities are taking place, highlighting an urgent need for the latest security updates from Microsoft.",
