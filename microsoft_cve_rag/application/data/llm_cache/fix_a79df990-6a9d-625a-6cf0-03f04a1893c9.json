  "description": "**Fix Overview**:\n\nTo correctly re-enable the Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE) on a Server 2022 Core installation without causing partition issues:\n\n1. Create a primary partition using the command:\n   `create partition primary`\n\n2. Format the new partition to NTFS with the label 'Windows RE Tools' using:\n   `format quick fs=ntfs label=\"Windows RE Tools\"`\n\n3. Set the partition ID to 27 with the command:\n   `set id=27`\n\nThese steps ensure that the WinRE installation has the proper partition type to be recognized during the setup.\n\n**Details**:\n- It's crucial to avoid altering the partition type after creating and labeling it, as subsequent actions can revert it to a default, which will prevent WinRE from functioning properly. This adjustment is especially relevant for Server 2022 Core where standard patching may not apply.\n- If you face difficulties with the installation due to detection issues, consider utilizing registry modifications as a workaround.
