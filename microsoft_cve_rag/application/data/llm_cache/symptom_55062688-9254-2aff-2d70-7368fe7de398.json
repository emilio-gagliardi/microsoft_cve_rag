  "description": "Users may experience a complete loss of network connectivity when operating with affected Windows Mobile Broadband drivers. This denial of service impacts multiple Windows versions, including Windows 10 version 22H2, Windows 11 versions 21H2, 22H2, 23H2, and 24H2 across various architectures (x64 and ARM64). Users may notice that the system fails to establish new network connections, which could disrupt their internet access and functionality related to network-dependent applications. The issue arises due to improper input validation and out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities in the driver, leading to performance degradation and unavailability. This condition persists until a remediation, such as the installation of updates referenced in KB articles like KB5044285 and KB5044273, is performed.",
