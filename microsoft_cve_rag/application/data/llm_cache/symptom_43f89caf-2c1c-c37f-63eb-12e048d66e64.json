  "description": "Users may experience a loss of confidentiality regarding sensitive data due to unauthorized read access to portions of kernel memory. This could lead to unauthorized exposure of information that individuals expect to be protected, especially when interacting with system-level applications or services. The affected systems include Windows 10 and Windows Server builds that meet the criteria specified in the relevance of the security update KB5034763. System administrators should be aware of the potential for increased information exposure in these environments, and consider implementing the updated patches to mitigate this risk. Builds impacted include Windows 10 versions 21H2 (10.0.19044.4046) and 22H2 (10.0.19045.4046), as well as Windows Server 2016 (10.0.14393.6709).",
