  "description": "Users of Microsoft Edge version 130.0.2849.46 may encounter situations where they are prompted to interact with malicious content due to a spoofing vulnerability. End users will notice that they need to perform specific actions, such as clicking on a link or executing a file, which can lead to these unexpected prompts appearing over legitimate user interface elements. This issue can make users susceptible to phishing attempts, as attackers could try to coax them into viewing specially crafted websites that leverage this vulnerability. As a result, users may experience confusion regarding the authenticity of the actions they are taking in the browser, which can compromise their security and overall user experience. For detailed guidance and fixes, users are directed to KB-130.0.2849.46 for more information.",
