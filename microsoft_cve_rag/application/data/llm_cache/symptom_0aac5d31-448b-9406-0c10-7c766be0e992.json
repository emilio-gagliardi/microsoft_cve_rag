  "description": "Users may experience potential information disclosure when using Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) version 131.0.2903.48 after the implementation of security patch KB49025. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access to personally identifiable information (PII) if a user opens a specially crafted file. Users must take action by clicking on links or files sent in emails or hosted on compromised websites, leading to the reading of sensitive data in their browsers. Due to this, system administrators need to be aware that the browser could transmit user data unexpectedly, which may affect user privacy and security protocols within their organization.",
