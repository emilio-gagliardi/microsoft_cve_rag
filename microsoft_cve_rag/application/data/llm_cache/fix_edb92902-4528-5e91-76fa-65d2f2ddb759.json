  "description": "Execute the provided PowerShell script to detect the presence of Adobe applications on both 64-bit and 32-bit Windows operating systems. The script first checks if the OS is 64-bit and lists Adobe applications installed under the 64-bit registry path. If no 64-bit installations are found, it then checks the 32-bit registry path for Adobe applications. For a 32-bit operating system, it directly checks only the 32-bit registry. This code allows system administrators to quickly verify the installation of required Adobe applications across different environments, facilitating compliance and management tasks.",
