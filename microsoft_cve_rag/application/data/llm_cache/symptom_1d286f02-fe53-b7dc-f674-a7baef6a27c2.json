  "description": "After February 12th, changes in CVEs have impacted the functioning of scanners, SIEM, or SOC tools that rely on NVD data. The alterations may lead to inaccuracies in vulnerability assessments conducted by these systems, causing delays in patch management processes. Organizations using these tools need to adjust their configurations or updates in light of the revised CVE data. These changes could particularly affect environments that heavily depend on timely vulnerability detection and remediation. The situation emphasizes the importance of staying updated with NVD data to ensure accurate vulnerability tracking.",
