  "description": "Kerberos requests on domain controllers can lead to memory leaks in the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS). This issue is particularly observed in Windows Server versions, including 2022, 2016, and 2012 R2. The symptoms manifest as degraded performance due to the continuing increase in memory usage by the LSASS process, potentially impacting the overall system stability and service availability. Relevant KB articles addressing this issue include KB-5037426, KB-5037423, KB-5037422, KB-5035885, and KB-5035857, which provide resolutions and workaround details tailored to affected server versions. System administrators should monitor memory usage closely and apply the recommended patches to prevent performance impact and service disruptions.",
