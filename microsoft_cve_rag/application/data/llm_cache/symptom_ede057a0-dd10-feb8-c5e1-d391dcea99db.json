  "description": "Windows 11 clients running version 22H2 may fail to receive approved updates when managed through Windows Server Update Services (WSUS). This issue can be attributed to the settings related to 'scan source policies' in Group Policy not being properly configured. After enabling these policies, the clients successfully detect and install the October updates, indicating that proper configuration of update source settings is crucial for update deployment in this environment.",
