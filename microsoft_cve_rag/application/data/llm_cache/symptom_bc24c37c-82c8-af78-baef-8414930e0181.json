  "description": "When opening a malicious RAR file, users may observe that unauthorized code is executed on the system. This behavior arises particularly on Windows 11 Version 23H2 and Version 22H2 for x64-based systems, with build number 10.0.22621.3880, when an authenticated attacker with basic privileges tricks a user into executing the file. Users may also notice other impacts, such as potential unauthorized access to system resources or unintended system modifications, stemming from the remote code execution vulnerability documented in KB5040442. Therefore, end-users should remain vigilant against suspicious files that may lead to such security incidents.",
