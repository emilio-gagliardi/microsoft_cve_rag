  "description": "After the BranchCache denial of service vulnerability is exploited, users may experience significant disruptions in network resource availability. This is characterized by the system's inability to provide access to necessary services or resources, which can occur both during the attack and persist after an attack has finished. End users may notice that certain network-dependent applications fail to load or operate correctly, demonstrating a total loss of service. The affected products include Windows 11 (various versions) and Windows Server editions, with build numbers such as 10.0.26100.2033 for Windows 11 24H2, and 6.3.9600.22221 for Windows Server 2012 R2, as referenced in KB5044284 and others. Administrators monitoring system metrics may observe spikes in resource consumption and subsequent alerts indicating service downtime as a direct result of this vulnerability being actively exploited.",
