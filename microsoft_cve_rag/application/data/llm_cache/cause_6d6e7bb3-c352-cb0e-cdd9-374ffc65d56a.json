  "description": "The vulnerability arises due to an observable discrepancy in the Windows cryptographic system, which enables information disclosure by allowing attackers to access decryption information from user mode processes. This flaw is rooted in the interaction of timing discrepancies during execution, which can be exploited to extract sensitive data, notably the contents of OAEP decrypt operations.",
