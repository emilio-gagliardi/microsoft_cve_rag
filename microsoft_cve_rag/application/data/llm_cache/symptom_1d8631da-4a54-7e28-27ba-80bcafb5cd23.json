  "description": "Users may experience unexpected privileges or access levels while using the Windows Remote Access Connection Manager, particularly in build numbers 10.0.19045.4291, 10.0.19044.4291, 10.0.22631.3447, 10.0.22000.2899, 10.0.22621.3447, and earlier versions listed in the related KB articles such as KB-5037788 and KB-5037771. This unexpected behavior can lead to unauthorized access to critical system functions, potentially compromising system security from the end user\u2019s perspective. Administrators might notice unusual account permissions or the inability for users to perform actions typically restricted to standard accounts, which could disrupt normal operational procedures. These symptoms may necessitate urgent attention to rectify the access misconfigurations caused by this vulnerability.",
