  "description": "After applying security updates referenced in KB-5036925, KB-5036894, KB-5036893, and KB-5036892, users may experience issues during the login process. This symptom can manifest as prolonged boot times or, in some cases, an inability to access the system altogether. Affected build numbers include 10.0.19045.4291, 10.0.19044.4291, and others detailed in the update guide. End users relying on secure boot may find themselves unable to authenticate, leading to potential delays in productivity and increased frustration. This behavior stems from the implications tied to the secure boot feature bypass vulnerability detailed in CVE-2024-26189.",
