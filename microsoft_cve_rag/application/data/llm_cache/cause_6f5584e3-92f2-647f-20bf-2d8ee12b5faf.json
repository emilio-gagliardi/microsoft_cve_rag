  "description": "The root cause identified in this context is the lack of an appropriate organizational unit (OU) structure for Win 11 machines in the remote sites, which complicates the management of Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) settings. By failing to create specific OUs solely for Win 11 devices and associated WSUS Group Policy Objects (GPOs), administrators face significant challenges in approving and managing updates tailored for this operating system. This oversight can lead to a cumbersome process where all Windows systems, irrespective of their build or requirements, are treated uniformly, resulting in potential update conflicts. Creating dedicated OUs aligns the update process with the actual environment, thereby enhancing the ease of deployment and reducing the administrative overhead necessary for ongoing management. Thus, implementing these changes is deemed the only feasible solution to streamline the management of Win 11 updates at remote locations.",
