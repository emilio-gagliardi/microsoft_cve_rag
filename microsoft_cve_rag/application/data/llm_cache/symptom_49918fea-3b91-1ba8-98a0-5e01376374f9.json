  "description": "After the installation of the updates corresponding to KB5040442, KB5040431, and KB5040427, users may experience an elevation of privilege issue within Windows Server 2022 and various Windows 11 versions. This symptom manifests as unauthorized access to perform actions that previously required higher user permissions, effectively allowing low-privileged users to gain more control over the system. Systems affected by build versions 10.0.22631.3880, 10.0.19045.4651, and others may lead to situations where an attacker can exploit these weaknesses locally or, in some cases, remotely. Administrators are advised to monitor affected systems closely for unexpected behavior related to user access levels following the application of these security updates.",
