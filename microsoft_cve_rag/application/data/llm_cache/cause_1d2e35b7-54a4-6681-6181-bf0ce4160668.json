  "description": "The elevation of privilege issue described in CVE-2023-36408 stems from a vulnerability in Windows Hyper-V, specifically allowing an unauthenticated attacker on a guest virtual machine (VM) to send carefully crafted file operation requests. These requests can effectively access and manipulate the hardware resources of the host server, leading to remote code execution. This issue is present across several builds of Windows, including 10.0.22631.2715, 10.0.19043.3693, and others, and is addressed in related updates documented in KB articles KB-5032192, KB-5032190, and KB-5032189. This vulnerability exposes high risks to confidentiality and integrity, allowing host resources to be compromised if exploited successfully.",
