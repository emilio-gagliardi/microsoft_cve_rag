  "description": "After connecting to a malicious SQL Server via OLE DB, users may notice unauthorized commands being executed in the context of their SQL client application. This behavior can lead to unexpected application behavior, including potential data loss or corruption. Users could also experience performance issues as a result of malicious code execution, which undermines the confidentiality and integrity of their data. In environments running Windows 10 (builds 10.0.10240.20526, 10.0.19045.4170), and Windows Server 2008/2012 (various builds), the consequences can be severe. It is crucial to review KB-5035858, KB-5035854, and other related articles for mitigation steps.",
