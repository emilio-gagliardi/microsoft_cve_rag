  "description": "Users may experience unauthorized access to sensitive resources following the installation of security updates for the Azure Identity Libraries and Microsoft Authentication Library due to an elevation of privilege vulnerability (CVE-2024-35255). The observed outcome can include scenarios where an attacker, with low privileges, gains read access to the files on the system directly, impacting the confidentiality of data stored within these files. This can manifest under builds associated with several programming languages such as Python, Java, and .NET, as detailed in security updates with KB-1.11.4. System administrators must assess the integrity of file systems across various applications to prevent potential exploits using these libraries. Regular monitoring and prompt application of updates are crucial to mitigate risk from this identified issue.",
