  "description": "The underlying cause for CVE-2024-20682 relates to improper handling of requests within the Windows Cryptographic Services that allows an attacked local component to execute arbitrary code. This vulnerability stems from a flaw in the processing of certain cryptographic requests where insufficient validation or restrictions on access control allow unauthorized operations. Essentially, this opens a pathway for an attacker with basic user privileges to exploit the service and gain control over the system. Locally accessible options such as the console or keyboard can be leveraged for exploitation, accentuating how an attacker could execute malicious commands remotely despite the localized attack vector. The affected products include various builds of Windows 10 and Windows 11, specifically within versions like 10.0.19044.3930 and 10.0.22631.3007, as noted in the associated KB articles KB-5034134 and others.",
