  "description": "When updating the ScreenConnect server, it is essential to also update the client to ensure compatibility and optimal performance. Failing to synchronize these updates may lead to issues such as connectivity problems and errors in remote sessions. This requirement indicates a dependency between the server and client components, which if overlooked, can disrupt user operations and administrative tasks. It necessitates maintenance awareness among system administrators to consistently perform both updates. This dynamic is critical for maintaining system integrity across the ScreenConnect platform.",
