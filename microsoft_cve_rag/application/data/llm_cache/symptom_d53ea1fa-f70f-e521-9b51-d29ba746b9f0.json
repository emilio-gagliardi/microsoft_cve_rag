  "description": "Users of Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) versions prior to 127.0.6533.72 may experience UI spoofing when interacting with certain HTML content. This behavior manifests when an attacker persuades a user to engage in specific user interface gestures, potentially misleading them into thinking they are interacting with legitimate content while they are not. Such exploitation can lead to serious security concerns as users may inadvertently disclose sensitive information or perform unwanted actions. The recently released update with build number 127.0.2651.74 addresses this issue and enhances users' protection against such deceptive interactions. It is crucial for system administrators to ensure that all users upgrade their Microsoft Edge browser to benefit from these critical security fixes as outlined in KB-127.0.2651.74.",
