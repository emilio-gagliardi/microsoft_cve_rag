  "description": "End users running affected versions of Windows 10 (build 10.0.19045.4780) and Windows 11 (build 10.0.26100.1457) may experience unauthorized elevation of privileges resulting in the potential alteration of system settings or access to sensitive resources. Users could find unexpected changes to their system configurations, as apps may behave unpredictably or disable key permissions without explicit user consent. Administrators might notice that unauthorized applications can run with higher privileges than intended, leading to potential stability issues or security risks. This symptom persists even across multiple builds including 21H2 (10.0.19044.4780) and 22H2, indicating a serious concern for anyone maintaining systems under these configurations. Users are advised to check for updates against the KB articles (KB-5041592, KB-5041585, KB-5041580, KB-5041571) to mitigate this risk.",
