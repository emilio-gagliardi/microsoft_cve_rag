  "description": "The underlying cause for the manual installs was linked to issues with the installation process for certain .NET components. Specifically, the process did not complete smoothly during the automated deployment via SCCM, prompting the necessity for manual intervention. This was highlighted in the context of KB-5036899, which addresses similar installation challenges. Additionally, after performing these manual installs, subsequent automated processes allowed SCCM to successfully install the required .NET components without further problems. Such occurrences suggest potential misconfiguration or limitations in the automatic patch management workflow, particularly when handling specific software packages or updates.",
