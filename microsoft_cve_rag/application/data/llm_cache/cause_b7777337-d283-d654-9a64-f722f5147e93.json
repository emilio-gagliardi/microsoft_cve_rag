  "description": "The underlying cause of the installation failure is related to insufficient disk space during the patch application process. In this specific case, the requirement of 250 MB of available storage was not met, leading to the failure of the installation. The lack of proper space management and monitoring can greatly affect the patching process. Utilizing an elevated PowerShell prompt to check available volume space can aid administrators in preemptively addressing this issue. Organizations should ensure that enough disk space is available for patch installations to mitigate this problem in future updates.",
