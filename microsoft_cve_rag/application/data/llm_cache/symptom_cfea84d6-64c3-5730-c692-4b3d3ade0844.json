  "description": "After updating to Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) version 122.0.2365.63, users may experience system stability issues, leading to unexpected crashes or application freezes. This observable behavior arises from potential conflicts or residual issues related to outdated components absorbed from the Chromium framework. Users may notice frequent app terminologies or loss of work due to these sudden crashes. Such behavior can degrade user experience significantly and may require frequent restarts or updates to resolve. For more information, refer to KB article released on February 29, 2024, with build number 122.0.2365.63.",
