  "description": "Users may experience deceptive behavior when using the Nearby Sharing feature on Windows systems. Specifically, the system could allow a malicious actor to spoof a device by presenting itself as a trusted device with the same name that the user is searching for. This can lead to confusion and potentially result in users unintentionally sharing sensitive information with the wrong device. Affected products include Windows 10 versions 21H2, 22H2, and Windows 11 versions 21H2, 22H2, and 23H2, as per the updates released with KB-5034121, KB-5034122, and KB-5034123. The exposure becomes apparent during user interaction, where the user must take action, making them susceptible to this spoofing vulnerability.",
