  "description": "The underlying cause of the vulnerability is an improper certificate validation in the Windows Cryptographic Services, which can lead to a remote code execution via a heap-based buffer overflow. This allows an attacker to exploit the vulnerability by importing a malicious certificate into the system, potentially enabling the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the same privileges as the user running the affected application.",
