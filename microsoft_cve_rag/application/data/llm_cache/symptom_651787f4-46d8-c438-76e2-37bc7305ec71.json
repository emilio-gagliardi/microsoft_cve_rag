  "description": "After updating to Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) version 128.0.2739.42, users may observe instability in the browser, which could manifest as frequent crashes or unexpected behavior during usage. These issues arise from a type confusion vulnerability in the underlying Chromium engine, which could impact page rendering and lead to security concerns. Users may also experience slow performance as a result of residual effects from the prior version. Such observable behaviors could impede workflow and user experience, necessitating prompt action from system administrators to mitigate these effects. The associated KB Article ID is KB-128.0.2739.42 for further reference.",
