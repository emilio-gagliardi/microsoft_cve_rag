  "description": "After applying the security update for Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) version 127.0.2651.98 as detailed in KB-127.0.2651.98, users may experience noticeable memory corruption issues. These issues manifest as unexpected application crashes and instability within the Edge browser. Users might notice that the browser closes abruptly without warning, resulting in potential loss of unsaved data. This behavior may be more prevalent during interactions with web content that require intensive memory operations or specific types of resource handling. Additionally, users could see error messages indicating that the browser has encountered a problem and needs to close, leading to interruptions during browsing sessions.",
