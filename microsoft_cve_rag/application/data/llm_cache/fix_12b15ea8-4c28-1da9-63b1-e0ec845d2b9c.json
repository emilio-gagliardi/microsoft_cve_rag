Configure UEFI Secure Boot settings in your VM settings to meet Windows 11 requirements.\n4. If your Windows 10 machine is still using legacy boot, use the `mbr2gpt` tool to convert to a GPT partitioning scheme.\n5. After the upgrade, enable Virtualization-Based Security (VBS) in the VM settings.\n\n**Details**:\n- These steps are crucial to meeting Windows 11's requirements for TPM and Secure Boot.
