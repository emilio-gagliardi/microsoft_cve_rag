  "description": "After the installation of security updates KB5039212 on affected Windows 11 systems, users may encounter increased vulnerability to local exploits that could lead to remote code execution. Particularly for machines running Windows 11 Version 22H2 and 23H2, users might experience unpredictable behavior when opening certain files, which could be a subtle indication that the system is at risk. Lack of immediate feedback may also lead to users unknowingly interacting with malicious content, compromising their systems. This can result in unauthorized access or execution of arbitrary code on their machines, elevating security risks significantly within the affected system environment.",
