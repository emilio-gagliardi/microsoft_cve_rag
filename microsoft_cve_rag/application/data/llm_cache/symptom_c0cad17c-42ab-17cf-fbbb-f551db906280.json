  "description": "After applying the 2024-08 cumulative update on Windows 11 clients, there is a notable absence of client status reports being generated in the Server 2022 WSUS environment. Although the clients are able to apply patches successfully and are correctly listed in the target groups, the reporting feature fails to reflect their status. This issue could lead to challenges in monitoring and managing the update process for these clients, potentially resulting in delays in addressing vulnerabilities or system health checks. Therefore, organizations relying on WSUS for client reporting may find it difficult to ensure compliance and up-to-date systems. System administrators may need to investigate further to determine the root cause and implement suitable solutions.",
