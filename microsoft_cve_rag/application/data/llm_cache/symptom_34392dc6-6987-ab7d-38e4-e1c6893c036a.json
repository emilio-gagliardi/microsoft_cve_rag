  "description": "The system experiences instability with the Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE) when utilizing a multi-disk setup, particularly when the OS and WinRE are located on different disks. This misconfiguration can lead to recovery being impossible if the OS disk is swapped out, as inferred from an observed behavior in about 15% of managed devices. Issues arise due to systems where the user's data is on one disk, while the OS and WinRE reside on another, complicating recovery options and adversely impacting system stability. Without appropriate adjustments or proper disk management, administrators may face significant challenges in disaster recovery scenarios.",
