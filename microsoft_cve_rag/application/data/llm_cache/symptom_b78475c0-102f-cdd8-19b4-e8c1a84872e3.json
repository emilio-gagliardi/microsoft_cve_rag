  "description": "The Windows systems exhibit unusual privilege escalation behaviors, allowing an authenticated user to gain additional rights beyond their original permissions. This is particularly concerning for system administrators as it raises the risk of unauthorized access or modifications to sensitive system files. For instance, an attacker exploiting this flaw could potentially modify crucial system files without appropriate user permissions, which can lead to a compromise of system integrity. The issue is reported across various Windows versions including Windows 10 (builds 10.0.19043.4529, 10.0.22621.3737) and Windows 11 (builds 10.0.22631.3737), as outlined in the accompanying KB article KB-5039212. The problem has a significant impact, categorized under an important severity type, which necessitates prompt attention from IT departments to mitigate risks.",
