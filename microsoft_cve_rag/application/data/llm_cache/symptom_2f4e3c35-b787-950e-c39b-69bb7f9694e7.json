  "description": "When a user enrolls a device in Intune as the first login and subsequently quits, it raises a concern regarding subsequent logins by different users. Specifically, if the device remains enrolled in Intune under the first user, it may cause confusion about whether the device must be wiped or rebooted for new users due to the ownership tie to the first user. This issue potentially impacts user management and device enrollment procedures, especially when deploying devices through the Group Policy Object (GPO) method. Ensuring proper device management during user transitions is crucial for maintaining security and compliance in an Active Directory environment. Proper documentation and protocols for onboarding and offboarding users can mitigate any associated risks.",
