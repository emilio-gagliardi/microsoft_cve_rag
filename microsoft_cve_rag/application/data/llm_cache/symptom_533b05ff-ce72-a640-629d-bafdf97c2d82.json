  "description": "The Windows Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS) may exhibit abnormal behavior resulting in the potential for remote code execution. Users may notice unexpected system crashes or instability when accessing configurations or services relying on RRAS. This may manifest as applications failing to respond or displaying error messages during operations that require routing functionalities, particularly for build numbers [10, 0, 19045, 4291], [10, 0, 19044, 4291], [10, 0, 22631, 3447], [10, 0, 22000, 2899], [10, 0, 22621, 3447], and [10, 0, 10240, 20596]. Administrators should be alert for signs of performance degradation or unusual behavior when utilizing network services that depend on RRAS, which could likely correlate with the application of KB articles KB-5036925, KB-5036894, KB-5036893, and KB-5036892. Such symptoms can significantly impede normal operations and pose an important concern for organizational security.",
