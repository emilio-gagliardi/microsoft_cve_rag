  "description": "**Tool Overview**:\n\nSoftware Restriction Policies (SRP) are a feature in Microsoft Windows that allows administrators to control the execution of software on the systems within their environment.\n\n**Details**:\n\n1. SRP can be configured to block specific applications, such as CoPilot, which can help prevent it from running outside of established business parameters.\n2. Administrators can define rules based on the file path, file hash, or publisher of the executable, making it flexible and powerful for managing application usage.\n3. To implement SRP, you would typically use the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) to create a policy that applies to the target systems.\n4. This approach is especially useful during regular business hours when the organization may not want CoPilot to be accessible to users.\n5. It is recommended to test the policies in a controlled environment before widespread deployment to ensure they do not inadvertently block legitimate applications.\n\n**Example Command**:\n```powershell\nSet-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned\nAdd-SoftwareRestrictionPolicy -FilePath \"C:\\Program Files\\CoPilot\\CoPilot.exe\" -Action Deny\n```",
