  "description": "**Fix Overview**:\n\nTo effectively manage updates for Microsoft Teams using policies:\n\n1. Define two separate policies in the Teams Admin Center:\n   - **Default Policy**: Block the new client for all users.\n   - **Early Adopters Policy**: Allow certain users to access new features, such as the new Teams client.\n\n2. Assign pilot or test users to the Early Adopters Policy to facilitate testing of new functions.\n\n**Details**:\n- Be mindful that the Teams client installs in the `AppData` folder, which can complicate centralized updates for all users on a machine. If a user lacks the necessary permissions during the update, the client may become uninstalled, resulting in no Teams installation on their profile. This could lead to confusion and interrupted workflow. (LLM Synthesized)\n\n**Preconditions**:\n- Ensure all users targeted for the Early Adopters Policy are aware of the new client functionalities and potential update issues.",
