  "description": "In systems running Windows 10 (builds 19043.4529 and 22631.3737) and Windows 11 (builds 22621.3737 and 22000.3019), end users may notice issues related to access privileges after applying the security update KB-5039212. The symptom may manifest as unexpected failures to access certain system resources or perform privileged operations, which can occur due to the potential elevation of privilege exploit addressed by this update. This behavior is particularly relevant for server variants, notably Windows Server 2012 R2 and older editions, where users might experience restricted access to administrative functions. As a result, the inability to execute necessary tasks could significantly impact productivity and operations in enterprise environments, highlighting the critical nature of applying fixes promptly to mitigate such risks.",
