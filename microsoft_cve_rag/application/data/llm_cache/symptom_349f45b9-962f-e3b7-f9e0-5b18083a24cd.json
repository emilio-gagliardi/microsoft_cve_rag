  "description": "The WSUS installer for the Windows 11 23H2 patch fails to apply updates on hardware that is not officially supported. This issue manifests during the upgrade process, whereby the installer does not recognize registry modifications that enabled the initial installation of Windows 11 on unsupported devices. As a result, system administrators are forced to manually upgrade these unsupported systems by utilizing a USB installer or ISO file, as the expected automatic update through WSUS does not function correctly.",
