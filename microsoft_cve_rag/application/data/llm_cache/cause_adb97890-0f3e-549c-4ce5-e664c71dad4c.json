  "description": "The underlying cause of the issue appears to be a timing problem that affects the display of the password dialog box during the authentication process. In the user experience described, after entering an email address and clicking the connect button, a 'blip' occurs where the password dialog should appear but does not remain visible. This inconsistency suggests a potential race condition in the UI rendering or video processing on certain systems, which is likely leading to the passwords dialog failing to display reliably. The user was able to work around this by actively engaging with the UI during the connection attempt, indicating that this issue does not affect all instances uniformly. Until a fix can be provided by Microsoft, users experiencing this wonky timing issue may need to use manual interventions to successfully log in.",
