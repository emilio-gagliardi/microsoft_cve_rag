This behavior is the result of a use-after-free vulnerability that can lead to heap corruption. As users interact with crafted HTML pages, the crashes become observable, disrupting the browsing experience. Those using affected build numbers, such as 126.0.2592.68, should be aware of these crashes which negatively impact productivity and system reliability.
