  "description": "A change in procedures related to domain join operations can result in Active Directory (AD) machine accounts retaining unwanted permissions associated with previous owner accounts. When replacing old machines with new ones that bear the same names, the decommissioning process becomes critical. If the previous machine's account is not correctly deleted and its security descriptor manually edited, the new machine might inherit permissions from its predecessor, potentially leading to risky configurations. This is particularly concerning if the previous owner account has not been removed, as unwanted permissions can persist and complicate security protocols. Implementing a robust process for managing machine accounts, including a thorough review of permissions after account deletion, is essential to safeguard against inadvertently granting access based on outdated credentials.",
