  "description": "After upgrading to build 24h2, users might experience severe network issues that result in complete crashes, causing extended delays during the login process. In this case, the system took approximately 45 minutes to reach the login screen, which severely impacts productivity. Moreover, the network stops functioning altogether, with no packets being sent or received, leading to a lack of connectivity. Reverting to the previous build, 22h2, resolves these network issues, resulting in a much-improved login time of just 15 seconds to reach the login screen. This situation highlights the significant performance regressions that may occur when deploying a new build of the operating system.",
