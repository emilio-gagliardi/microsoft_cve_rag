  "description": "The cause of the issue lies in the misconfiguration of the Windows Update settings for Windows 11 22H2 machines. Specifically, the use of the registry key '[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\WindowsUpdate]' with the value 'targetReleaseVersion' set to '00000001' is preventing the November updates from being offered to those machines. Instead, they are being directed towards the upgrade to version 23H2, which is not desired at this time. This behavior appears to differ from previous versions like Windows 10, where cumulative updates would still be available even when a newer version was targeted. By adjusting the target version within the registry, the user was able to successfully receive the November updates again. This indicates a potential oversight in the patch management process when managing upgrade paths versus cumulative updates for Windows 11.",
