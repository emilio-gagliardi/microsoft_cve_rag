  "description": "Inconsistent updates of the ScreenConnect server and its associated client can lead to functionality issues or failure in remote connectivity. This misalignment occurs when the server is upgraded without simultaneously upgrading the client. The absence of this crucial synchronization may result in compatibility errors, which could manifest as connection failures or reduced performance. Admins must ensure that both the server and client are updated in tandem to maintain system integrity. This recommendation is essential when managing ScreenConnect deployments to avoid unexpected downtime or degraded service quality.",
