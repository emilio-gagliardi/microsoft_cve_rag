  "description": "Visual Studio 2022 version 17.9.7 is no longer being synchronized with the Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), leading to a lack of updates and support for that version. The expired status can prevent users from receiving critical updates, which may leave them with outdated software functionality and potentially expose them to bugs that will not be patched. The issue arises particularly in enterprises relying on WSUS for patch deployment, placing the burden on system administrators to seek out and apply updates manually. Searching for solutions in available documentation may also yield limited results, as community discussions around this specific expiration appear to be sparse.",
