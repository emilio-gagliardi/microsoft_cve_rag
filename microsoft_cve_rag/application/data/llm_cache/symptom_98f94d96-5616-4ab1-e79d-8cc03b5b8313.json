  "description": "The removal of the license requirement in version 23.9.10 enables users running any previous version of the software to upgrade to the latest version without restrictions. This can lead to unexpected behavior if previous installations had unaddressed issues that were not carried forward into the newer build. As such, systems may encounter compatibility problems or operational discrepancies that arise from this unregulated upgrade path. System administrators should be aware that this change could affect the stability and functionality of the applications in environments that are not monitored during upgrades. Careful assessment of the application\u2019s performance and configurations after migration is advised to mitigate any potential disruptions.",
