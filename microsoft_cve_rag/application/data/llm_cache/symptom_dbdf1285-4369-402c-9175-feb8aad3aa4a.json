  "description": "The WSUS parent servers do not accurately reflect supersedence information for certain updates. Specifically, KB4486726 appears not to be recognized as superseded on the parent servers, despite showing correct supersedence on child servers where it is noted to be superseded by KB5002121 and others. This discrepancy leads to failures in managing updates effectively, causing superseded updates to remain on the parent servers and not be declined as intended, potentially leading to deployment inefficiencies.",
