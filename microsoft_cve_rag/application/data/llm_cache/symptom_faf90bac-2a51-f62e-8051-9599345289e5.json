  "description": "Users of Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) version 128.0.2739.42 may experience unexpected UI behavior caused by the inappropriate handling of extensions. The browser is vulnerable to UI spoofing, which could mislead the user by displaying deceptive content in the interface. This can lead to the user unknowingly interacting with harmful elements, such as entering sensitive information into spoofed forms. It is crucial for system administrators to monitor user feedback and reports of unusual behavior or unexpected prompts when using the browser to ensure a secure environment. Users are encouraged to verify they are running the latest version, 128.0.6613.84 or newer, to mitigate these issues, as outlined in KB-128.0.2739.42.",
