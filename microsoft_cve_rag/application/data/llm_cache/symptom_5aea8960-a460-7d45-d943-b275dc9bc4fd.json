  "description": "Enabling the 'In-Private Strict' security setting leads to unexpected behavior when accessing the web. Users reporting this issue have found that setting the 'Enhance your security on the web' option to 'On/Strict' disrupts their browsing experience, while the 'Off' and 'On/Balanced' settings work correctly. When this strict option is active, attempting to open an In-Private window results in restricted access to web content, hindering functionality. This can impact various web applications and sites that rely on standard access protocols. Testing has confirmed that toggling this option significantly alters the behavior of In-Private sessions, indicating a configuration conflict.",
