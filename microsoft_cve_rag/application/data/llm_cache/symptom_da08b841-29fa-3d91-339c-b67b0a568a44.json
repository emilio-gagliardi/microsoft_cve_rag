  "description": "Users experiencing version 131.0.2903.63 of Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) may notice unexpected crashes or instability due to a type confusion vulnerability in the underlying Chromium framework. This instability can manifest as the browser unexpectedly closing or freezing while loading web pages, particularly those containing complex HTML content. The issue arises from a flaw that allows heap corruption, potentially affecting user experience and productivity. System administrators managing this version should be aware of these observable impacts while users interact with the browser. The associated resolution is addressed in the latest security update, indicating that users should update to version 131.0.6778.85 or later to mitigate these effects.",
