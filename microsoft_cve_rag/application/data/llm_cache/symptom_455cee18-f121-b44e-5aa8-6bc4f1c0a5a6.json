  "description": "After updating Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) to build 129.0.2792.65 or 128.0.2739.97, users may experience crashes when accessing certain web pages. This could be a result of the underlying type confusion vulnerability that was addressed in the updates for CVE-2024-9122. Users have reported that specific actions, such as loading heavy JavaScript content or navigating between tabs, lead to unexpected termination of the Edge browser. For the most reliable performance, it is recommended to verify that the update was applied successfully by checking the version through the Edge menu. These crashes can disrupt workflow and lead to potential loss of unsaved data, making it essential for administrators to ensure users are updated to the latest builds.",
