  "description": "End users may experience significant disruptions when using systems with the Windows Mobile Broadband driver due to a remote code execution vulnerability. This could manifest as unexpected application behavior or system instability, making certain applications unresponsive or causing abrupt closures. The affected build numbers include Windows 11 Version 24H2 (10.0.26100.2033) and various builds of Windows 10 and Windows 11. Users on these platforms, detailed in KB articles such as KB5044284 and KB5044273, may also encounter performance degradation or unanticipated errors, particularly around network connectivity and security features relying on the broadband driver. Therefore, administrators should monitor their systems closely for these observable impacts and consider applying the recommended updates promptly to mitigate these issues.",
