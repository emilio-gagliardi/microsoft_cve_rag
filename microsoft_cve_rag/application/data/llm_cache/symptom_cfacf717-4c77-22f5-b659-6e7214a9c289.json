  "description": "The WS_FTP Server has been identified with two critical vulnerabilities, CVE-2023-40044 and CVE-2023-42657, which pose severe risks to system security. CVE-2023-40044, with a severity rating of 10, permits attackers to execute malicious code with elevated system privileges without any authentication, thus enabling potential takeover of affected systems. Additionally, CVE-2023-42657, although slightly less severe with a rating of 9.9, still allows for remote code execution, albeit requiring the hacker to authenticate first, highlighting the necessity for immediate patching to mitigate these critical vulnerabilities.",
