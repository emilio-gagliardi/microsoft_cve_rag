  "description": "**Fix Overview**:\n\nTo ensure successful installation and operation of the recovery partition:\n\n1. Verify that the recovery partition is located to the right of the main operating system partition.\n\n2. If the recovery partition is on the left of the C: drive, do not resize the existing partition. Instead, create a new recovery partition.\n\n3. Retain the old recovery partition and do not remove it; instead, move the winre.wim file to the newly created partition.\n\n**Preconditions**:\n- Ensure that there is a minimum of 250MB of free space on the new recovery partition before proceeding.",
