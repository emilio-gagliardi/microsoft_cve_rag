  "description": "In systems running Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) version 126.0.2592.56 and prior, users may experience crashes when interacting with crafted PDF files. This behavior occurs as a result of underlying issues related to a use-after-free vulnerability identified in the pdfium component. Users will notice the browser abruptly closing when attempting to open or view certain PDF documents, leading to potential data loss or disrupted workflows. This issue has been addressed in later versions of Microsoft Edge, eliminating the observed crashing behavior, and can be referenced in KB Article KB-126.0.2592.56 and CVE-2024-5847 for further details. System administrators are advised to ensure that their environments are running the latest version to avoid these disruptive experiences.",
