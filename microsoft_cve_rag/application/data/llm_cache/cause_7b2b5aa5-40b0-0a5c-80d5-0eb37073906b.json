  "description": "The identified vulnerability arises from a 'Use After Free' condition in the Windows SMB protocol, which allows attackers to potentially trigger a denial of service. This flaw can be exploited remotely, allowing an attacker to access the network stack without the need for prior authorization or user interaction, leading to a complete loss of service availability in affected systems. The specific affected builds include Windows 11 versions 24H2, 23H2, and 22H2, as well as Windows Server 2022 and 2025.",
