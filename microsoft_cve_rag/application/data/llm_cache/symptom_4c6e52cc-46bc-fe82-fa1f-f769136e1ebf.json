  "description": "The system is experiencing issues with access to specific .sys files, which is leading to potential crashes and blue screen of death (BSOD) errors. Attempts to control this issue have included exploring the use of AppLocker and Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) through Intune, but these methods may not sufficiently restrict access to critical system files. The ongoing struggle to block this file access indicates a broader problem that may impact stability, particularly on Windows endpoints. System administrators are advised to explore alternative solutions to prevent the adverse effects of file access issues on overall system performance and reliability.",
