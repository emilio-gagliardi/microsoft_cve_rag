  "description": "The presence of a remote code execution vulnerability in the Windows Mobile Broadband Driver may lead to unauthorized access to system resources. Users could experience unexpected behaviors such as unauthorized applications running or system processes being manipulated without consent. This can result in the compromise of sensitive information and a complete loss of control over the affected device. The devices affected include Windows 10 versions 21H2 and 22H2, along with Windows 11 versions, each identified by specific build numbers such as 10.0.19045.5011 and 10.0.26100.2033. Those managing these systems should be especially vigilant for any unusual activity or modifications following the security update, as indicated in KB Articles KB5044273, KB5044284, and KB5044285.",
