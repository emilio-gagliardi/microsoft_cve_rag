  "description": "The WinRE partition problem is causing significant update failures across a substantial percentage of endpoints, approximately 20-30%. Since January 2024, the cumulative updates for Windows have mandated a larger recovery partition compared to previous versions. This has necessitated a manual intervention on every affected workstation to resize the recovery partition. Unfortunately, this manual process only resolves the issue for about half of the affected system instances, with the remaining requiring partition editing software. This situation leads to extensive downtime and increased operational overhead for system administrators tasked with maintaining system updates.",
