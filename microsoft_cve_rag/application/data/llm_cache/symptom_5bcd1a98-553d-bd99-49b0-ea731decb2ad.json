  "description": "End users may experience difficulties with Kerberos authentication in Windows environments running affected builds post-patch application. Specifically, users might notice failed login attempts when accessing network resources that require authentication. This can manifest as repeated prompts for credentials or outright failure messages, indicating that authorization has not been granted despite valid credentials being entered. The impact may vary based on the specific Windows build in use, with affected versions including Windows 10 Version 22H2 (10.0.19045.4170), Windows 10 Version 21H2 (10.0.19044.4170), and multiple builds of Windows 11. Administrators should refer to KB Article IDs KB-5035858, KB-5035854, and KB-5035853 for remediation instructions, as failure to address this issue could lead to significant access problems within enterprise applications reliant on Kerberos authentication.",
