  "description": "Users may experience the desktop screen becoming unresponsive when attempting to launch Microsoft Office. This behavior indicates a problem with the software's initialization process, which can derail productivity. Users might see the Office splash screen indefinitely without progressing to the main user interface, suggesting issues with recent updates or configuration settings. Such symptoms may correlate with specific Office build numbers, although these details were not explicitly provided in the context. For diagnosis, referring to known issues in relevant KB articles could help identify if this problem has affected other users and whether a fix is available.",
