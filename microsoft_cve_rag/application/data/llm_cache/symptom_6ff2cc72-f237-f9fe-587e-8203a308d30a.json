  "description": "The Windows Update and Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) are unable to function automatically, necessitating manual intervention to stop and disable these services. This typically occurs when issues in the Software Distribution folder, particularly in the staging folders, disrupt the update process. As a result, system administrators must manually delete contents from the folder located at 'C: \\ $ windows.~ bt' and adjust registry settings for product version to restore normal update functionality.",
