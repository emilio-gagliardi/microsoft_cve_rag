  "description": "Users experience 'Not Implemented' errors when attempting to open JPG files with the default Windows Photo app. Although these files open successfully in alternative applications like Paint or Paint 3D, the default photo viewer fails to render them. Recent reports indicate this issue is occurring on multiple PCs and may indicate a broader problem with the Windows Photo app itself. Attempts to resolve the issue by uninstalling and reinstalling the app, as well as performing a repair and reset, have proven unsuccessful. As a temporary workaround, users are advised to set Paint as the default application for opening JPG files until the root cause of the error can be identified and addressed.",
