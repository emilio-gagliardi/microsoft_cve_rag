  "description": "**Fix Overview**:\n\nWhen troubleshooting a system boot issue, the following steps can be taken:\n\n1. Check for multiple partitions; the Windows installation might not always be on the C: drive; it can sometimes be on D: as well.\n\n2. If the user has an external USB device that is BitLocker encrypted, expect that Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE) may require the BitLocker key from the device instead of using the internal Active Directory stored key.\n\n3. If the system does not boot into recovery, utilize a Windows 10 or 11 installation medium created with the Windows Media Creation Tool to access WinRE.\n\n**Details**:\n- Ensure you have access to the BitLocker key if using an external device.\n- Create a bootable installation medium ahead of time to expedite the recovery process.
