  "description": "When users initiate a download in Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) version 126.0.2592.56, the expected permissions dialog that prompts for user action may not be presented. This means that users attempting to download files could do so without receiving any warnings or prompts about the potential risks associated with the download. Such behavior can lead to unexpected interactions with malicious URLs, where the user inadvertently clicks on a crafted link, thinking they are engaging with a safe download, ultimately compromising their information integrity. The endpoint's ability to warn users about potentially harmful downloads is severely diminished, allowing attackers to exploit this oversight by redirecting users to undesirable locations. This issue is documented in KB30058 and impacts build numbers associated with Microsoft Edge version 126.0.2592.56.",
