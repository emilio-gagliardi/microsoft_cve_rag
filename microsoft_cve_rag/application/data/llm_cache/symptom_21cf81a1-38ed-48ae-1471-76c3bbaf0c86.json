  "description": "Users may experience issues with Microsoft Word when saving documents that contain capitalized file extensions. This observation is particularly noted with the Spanish language version of Word, version 2409 build 18025. Users have indicated that saving documents to a local folder might lead to problems if extensions are capitalized, although there are instances where it saves and reopens correctly. These discrepancies may affect the document management workflow, especially for those managing files with varying naming conventions. Users should verify file extension handling and test different scenarios when operating with this specific version to mitigate any unexpected behavior.",
