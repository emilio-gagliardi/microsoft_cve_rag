  "description": "The issue arises from the use of uninitialized resources within the Windows authentication mechanism, specifically allowing attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive heap memory segments. This can lead to information disclosure, where an attacker can read portions of memory that may contain confidential data. The vulnerability is present in various Windows builds, particularly affecting Windows 10 and Windows 11, as outlined in several corresponding KB articles.",
