  "description": "Users of Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) version 126.0.2592.68 may experience unexpected redirection to potentially malicious sites after clicking on specially crafted URLs. This behavior could lead to a loss of integrity as attackers are able to modify the content of these vulnerable links. Consequently, the impact of this flaw manifests in users encountering misleading or dangerous web pages without prior warning. System administrators should be aware that this symptom may arise when users interact with compromised links, making it imperative to consider user education and awareness as part of the security strategy. The corresponding KB Article for this issue is KB38082.",
