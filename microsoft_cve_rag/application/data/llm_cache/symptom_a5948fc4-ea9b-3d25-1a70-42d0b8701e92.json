  "description": "When configuring LDAP over STARTTLS or LDAPS in Active Directory, users may encounter inconsistent connection success rates. Specifically, when utilizing the actual domain name for connections, such as contoso.local, the likelihood of establishing a valid TLS connection improves significantly as opposed to using IP addresses or fully qualified domain names (FQDNs). This issue could stem from improper certificate validation against domain controllers (DC) certificates. System administrators should utilize tools like OpenSSL to verify the certificates presented during these TLS connections. Checking the certificates might reveal mismatches or validation errors that prevent secure connections to directory services.",
