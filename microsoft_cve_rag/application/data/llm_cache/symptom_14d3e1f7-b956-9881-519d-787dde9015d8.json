  "description": "End users may find that certain operations intended to elevate privileges on Windows systems fail to execute correctly following the installation of security updates associated with CVE-2024-38248. Specifically, this issue can arise in multiple builds of Windows, including Windows 11 versions 24H2 (10.0.26100.1742) and 23H2 (10.0.22631.4169) as well as Windows 10 versions 22H2 (10.0.19045.4894) and 21H2 (10.0.19044.4894), among others. Users might encounter permission denial or an inability to access certain system resources that previously required higher privileges. The impact is critical for work scenarios involving user rights modifications and administrative tasks, potentially causing interruptions in workflows. To address these issues, Microsoft has released several associated KB articles including KB5043080, KB5043076, KB5043067, and KB5043064, which users should reference to apply necessary updates and mitigate these behaviors.",
