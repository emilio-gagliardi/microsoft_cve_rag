Users are advised to try updating meetings using the new Outlook desktop client or Outlook on the web. Access it via: [Outlook on the Web](https://outlook.office365.com/calendar/view/day).\n\n2. For existing calendar items that encounter conflict errors, refer to the steps in the support article provided under 'workaround 2': [Conflict Errors in Outlook](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/outlook-shows-conflict-errors-when-updating-or-cancelling-meetings-69c26227-40ef-4377-8f12-1749fcaad2ad).\n\n3. If duplicates of calendar items were created, follow the steps in 'workaround 3' within the same article to resolve this issue.\n\n**Details**:\n- The service degradation began on Jun 10, 2024, affecting the ability of users to update or cancel calendar items.\n- While the recent fix will prevent further issues, it does not remedy existing calendar item conflicts or duplicates. Continuous monitoring of service telemetry is ongoing to ensure the solution is effective.\n",
