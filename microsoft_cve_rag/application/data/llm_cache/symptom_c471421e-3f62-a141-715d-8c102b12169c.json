  "description": "Systems utilizing the Windows Layer-2 Bridge network driver may experience a total loss of availability, leading to denial of service for end users. In particular, users running affected versions like Windows 10 (builds 19044.4780 and 22631.4037) and Windows 11 (builds 22631.4037 and 19045.4780) are likely to notice that network connectivity is entirely disrupted, preventing access to resources. The root cause stems from a null pointer dereference issue identified in CVE-2024-38146, as detailed in KB articles such as KB-5041592 and KB-5041580. Administrators should be aware that the impact may vary but generally results in a persistent denial of access, significantly affecting business operations and user productivity until the security updates are applied.",
