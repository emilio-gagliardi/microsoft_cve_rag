  "description": "The cause of the installation issue appears to stem from the improper handling of the ISO image and its mounting process. Specifically, if the ISO file is not correctly mounted without a drive letter, it can disrupt the setup process for Windows 10 version 22H2. The commands outlined in the post suggest using PowerShell to mount the ISO and then set a drive letter, which must be done accurately to ensure accessibility during installation. Inadequate configuration during setup can lead to failures such as the system being unable to locate necessary installation files. This ultimately prevents the auto-upgrade process from executing, as indicated by the KB article KB-5041580 which discusses related setup errors.",
