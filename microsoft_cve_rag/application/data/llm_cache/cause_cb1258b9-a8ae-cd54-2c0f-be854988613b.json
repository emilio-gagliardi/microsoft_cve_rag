  "description": "The root cause is a use-after-free condition in the Windows Line Printer Daemon (LPD) service, allowing remote code execution from an unauthenticated attacker sending specially crafted print tasks. This occurs when the service mishandles memory, leading to unintended access and execution of code within the operating context of the service. The vulnerability affects multiple Windows 10 and Windows 11 builds and is capable of exploitation across network layers, with significant implications for confidentiality, integrity, and availability.",
