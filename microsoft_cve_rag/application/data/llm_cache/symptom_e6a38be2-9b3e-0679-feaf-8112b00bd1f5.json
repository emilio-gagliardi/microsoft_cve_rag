  "description": "End users may experience unauthorized local access on their systems where a local, authenticated attacker gains elevated local system or administrator privileges through a vulnerability in the win32k.sys driver. This can lead to unexpected behaviors such as the ability to modify sensitive settings or files that could compromise system integrity. The affected Windows versions include those with build numbers 10.0.19045.4412, 10.0.22631.3593, and others as outlined in KB articles KB-5037788 and KB-5037771. Users might notice anomalies, such as unauthorized installation of software or changes in system configurations, which could indicate that their system has been compromised.",
