  "description": "The process of keeping Office 2016 updated on newly refreshed or re-imaged systems presents challenges due to a large volume of manual work required to review and apply updates from 2015 onwards. Despite using tools like osdupdate and PowerShell to gather applicable patches, system administrators often face difficulties ensuring that all devices are equipped with the latest updates and patches. As Office 2016 lacks new roll-ups or service packs by design, this situation pushes organizations towards adopting Microsoft 365 and Click-to-Run technologies effectively.",
