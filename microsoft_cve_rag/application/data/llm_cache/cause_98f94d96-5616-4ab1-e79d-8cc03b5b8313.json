  "description": "The removal of the license requirement to upgrade to version 23.9.10 presents a significant shift in upgrade policy for the affected software. This change allows users on any previous version to upgrade directly to the latest release, enhancing accessibility for all users but potentially leading to a lack of compliance with licensing agreements. While this upgrade flexibility is beneficial, it may inadvertently lead to unlicensed instances of the software being used within organizations. Additionally, the ease of access to upgrades raises concerns about possible oversights in version control and tracking, which could render previously established IT governance ineffective. Organizations should thus monitor the upgrade paths and ensure compliance even in light of these policy changes.",
