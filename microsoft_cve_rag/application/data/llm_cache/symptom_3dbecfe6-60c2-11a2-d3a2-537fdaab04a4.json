  "description": "Users may experience unauthorized access or control over their system after executing a malicious Universal Windows Platform (UWP) application. This behavior stems from vulnerabilities that allow an attacker with basic user privileges to elevate access, potentially leading to unauthorized changes or data breaches. The impacted systems include Windows server versions and specific builds of Windows 10 and 11, detailed in KB articles such as KB5033379 and KB5033375, in build versions including 10.0.22000.2652 and 10.0.19045.3803.",
