  "description": "Users may experience unauthorized code execution when running performance counter collection tools on affected systems. Specifically, if the Performance Monitor tool is used to gather performance counter data, an attacker with administrative privileges on their machine can exploit this vulnerability to execute malicious code within the performance data collector process on the victim's machine. This could lead to significant security breaches as sensitive information could be exposed and compromised. Affected products include Windows 11 (various build numbers) and several Windows Server versions, as outlined in KB articles such as KB5040442 and KB5040431. Administrators should verify that their systems running these builds are up-to-date to mitigate potential risks associated with this issue.",
