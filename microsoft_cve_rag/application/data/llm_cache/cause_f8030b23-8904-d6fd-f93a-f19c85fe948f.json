  "description": "The underlying cause of the issue relates to the default configuration of the anti-spam outbound policy in Microsoft\u2019s security features. Specifically, the policy is set to send a copy of suspicious outbound messages, which may inadvertently lead to a flood of spam reports and monitoring overhead for system administrators. By leaving this setting enabled, organizations risk exposing themselves to potential issues in message delivery, as legitimate emails could be mistakenly flagged as suspicious. This misconfiguration can lead to inefficiencies in email management and can contribute to an ineffective email filtering strategy. Addressing this concern is crucial for maintaining the integrity of outbound communications and optimizing the performance of security protocols.",
