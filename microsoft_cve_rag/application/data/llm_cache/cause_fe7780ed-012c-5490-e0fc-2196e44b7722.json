  "description": "The primary cause for the potential issues indicated is the lack of a graphical user interface (GUI) method within Windows to manage certain operations, leading home users to rely on third-party applications. This situation can result in serious complications during updates, particularly for those less familiar with technical processes. Specifically, tools such as Minitool Partition Wizard and AOMEI Partition Assistant are cited, which may not seamlessly integrate with recent updates. Without native support, users may encounter hurdles that can lead to data loss or system instability. The absence of adequate GUI tools restricts the ability of users to perform necessary actions effectively in a user-friendly manner.",
