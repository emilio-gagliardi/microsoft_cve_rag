  "description": "**Fix Overview**:\n\nTo properly apply the Microsoft SQL security patches in conjunction with cumulative updates (CUs):\n\n1. Ensure that the actual cumulative update for SQL Server (in this case, SQL Server 2019) is deployed first.\n2. After deploying the CU, proceed to install the SQL security patches, as they supercede the existing CU.\n\n**Details**:\n- Deploying the CU first ensures that the patching process follows the required order of installation, preventing the security patch from blocking the CU installation.\n- Confirm that both the security patches and CUs are compatible with your SQL Server version, to avoid any installation issues.
