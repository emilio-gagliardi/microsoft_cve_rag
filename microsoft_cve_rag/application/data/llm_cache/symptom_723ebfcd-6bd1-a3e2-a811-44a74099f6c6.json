  "description": "After updating to Microsoft Edge version 126.0.2592.113, users may experience system crashes or instability due to unresolved issues linked to a race condition in the underlying Chromium framework. This behavior can manifest as the browser unexpectedly closing or failing to respond while interacting with certain extensions or web pages. While this security update addresses the vulnerability cited in CVE-2024-6778, the underlying integration may still trigger errors on affected systems that previously used older builds of Edge or Chrome. Users should monitor performance closely and ensure that they are operating the latest versions of both Edge and its underlying Chromium framework to avoid these crashes. More detailed version information can be found in the release notes associated with KB-126.0.2592.113.",
