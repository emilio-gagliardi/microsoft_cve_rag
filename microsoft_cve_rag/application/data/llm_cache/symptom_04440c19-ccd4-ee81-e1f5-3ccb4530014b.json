  "description": "System administrators may observe unexpected behavior when using the Windows IP Routing Management Snap-in, potentially allowing remote code execution upon user interaction. Specifically, an attacker could trick a user into connecting to a malicious server, leading to arbitrary code execution on the user's system. In the context of this vulnerability (CVE-2024-38115), affected products include various builds of Windows 10 and Windows 11, specifically version 24H2 (KB5041571), version 23H2 (KB5041585), version 22H2 (KB5041585), and version 21H2 (KB5041592). Users may notice increased network activity or unresponsive behavior when attempting to use the routing management features. Administrative functions relying on this component may exhibit failures or limitations due to unauthorized actions enabled by malicious code execution.",
