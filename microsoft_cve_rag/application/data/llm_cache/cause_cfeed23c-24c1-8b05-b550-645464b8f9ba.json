  "description": "The cause of the identified issue relates to a lack of appropriate patch management strategies to ensure that all devices within the organization are updated consistently. Specifically, the failure to adhere to industry best practices for operational excellence has led to instances where critical updates, referenced in KB200224 and KB10036, may not have been applied in a timely manner, exposing the organization to potential vulnerabilities. This is exacerbated by the absence of a continuous monitoring system which is essential to track compliance with patch requirements. Implementing a structured approach to patch management that regularly reviews and updates all endpoints is crucial for maintaining operational integrity. Therefore, without these practices in place, the organization remains susceptible to the consequences of unaddressed software flaws.",
