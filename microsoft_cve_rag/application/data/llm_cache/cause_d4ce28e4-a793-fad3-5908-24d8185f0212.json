  "description": "The underlying cause of the printing issues observed on the Win10 Pro 22H2 system was related to the presence of the HP Smart application, which was not necessary for this system as it had no HP devices. Despite being manually removed, remnants of HP Smart affected the printer functionality, leading to jobs being misrouted to the wrong printer queue. The troubleshooter worked to clean up these residual configurations and restore proper functionality by updating the default printer settings. Users reported that without this cleanup, issues persisted with incorrect printer behavior. Although the cleanup was effective, there remain concerns about the potential for future installations or unwanted downloads of HP Smart affecting printer functionality again.",
