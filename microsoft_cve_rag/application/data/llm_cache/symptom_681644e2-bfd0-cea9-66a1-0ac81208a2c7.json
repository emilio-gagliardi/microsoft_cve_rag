  "description": "After installing security updates KB-5035855, KB-5035849, and KB-5035845 on Windows 10 Version 22H2 and 21H2 (both x64 and 32-bit systems), users may observe that certain applications or processes can be executed with elevated privileges unexpectedly. This behavior may allow unauthorized actions, leading to potential data exposure or system misconfiguration. Administrators should monitor for any unusual access patterns or unexpected behavior in user sessions after the updates are applied. It is important to ensure that all systems running build numbers 10.0.19045.4170 and 10.0.19044.4170 are evaluated for this issue, as it directly impacts the security posture of the systems involved.",
