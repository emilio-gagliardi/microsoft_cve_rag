  "description": "Users of Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) version 122.0.2365.52 may experience issues related to spoofing of the security user interface. This behavior is a result of an improper implementation in navigation which could potentially allow for security UI elements to be misrepresented. Although this issue does not result in direct crashes or performance degradation, the possibility of misleading security information can lead to confusion or an unintentional overlooking of real security threats. As a precaution, it is recommended that users ensure their browser is updated to the latest version, as the security update addressing this concern is now available as of February 23, 2024, in KB-122.0.2365.52. The severity of this issue has been classified with a low impact level, yet it is crucial for administrators to be aware of the potential implications of UI spoofing in secure browsing environments.",
