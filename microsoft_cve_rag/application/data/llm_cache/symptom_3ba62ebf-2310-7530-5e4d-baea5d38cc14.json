  "description": "After the security update, users may experience significant disruptions in service availability related to the Windows Container Manager. Systems may show signs of complete denial of access to resources, leading to persistent unavailability for end-users. Administrators will note that services associated with the container manager are interrupted, impacting applications relying on these containers. These observable behaviors could stem from the improper link resolution before file access, and could require immediate attention to restore normal operations. Affected builds include Windows 10 versions 21H2 and 22H2, Windows 11 versions 21H2 and 22H2, with corresponding KB articles KB5039211 and KB5039212 for reference.",
