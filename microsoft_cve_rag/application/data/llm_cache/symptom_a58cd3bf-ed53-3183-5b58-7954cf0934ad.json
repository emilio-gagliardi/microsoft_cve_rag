  "description": "After updating to Microsoft Edge version 122.0.2365.63 on Windows 10, users experience frequent crashes of the browser with error messages indicating 'out of memory' or 'this page is having a problem'. The issue persists not only when loading external web pages but also prevents access to the Edge settings page, rendering the browser unusable for users attempting to modify their configurations. Downgrading to the previous version, 122.0.2365.59, appears to resolve the problem, indicating a regression in the newer build. While some users have reported stable operations on different systems or versions, others have shared similar complaints across forums, suggesting a broader impact of this build on Edge's functionality.",
