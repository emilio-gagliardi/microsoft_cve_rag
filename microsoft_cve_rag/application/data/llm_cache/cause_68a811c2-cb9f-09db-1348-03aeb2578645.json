  "description": "The cause of the issue described in CVE-2023-36024 is an elevation of privilege vulnerability in Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) versions 119.0.2151.58 and 118.0.2088.102. This vulnerability can be traced back to the way the browser handles specially crafted files. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to open a specially crafted file, leading to a potential browser sandbox escape. This lack of proper restrictions allows unauthorized users to execute code remotely, which can compromise the integrity and confidentiality of a system. The remediation can be found in Microsoft Knowledge Base article KB-119.0.2151.58, which provides details on security updates necessary to mitigate the issue.",
