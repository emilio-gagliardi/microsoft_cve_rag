  "description": "The underlying cause for the issue addressed in the post is related to how different Adobe application installations are recognized by the system, specifically concerning their registry entries. The PowerShell code provided identifies whether a 64-bit or 32-bit version of Adobe software is installed by querying the appropriate registry keys. In a 64-bit operating system, it checks both 64-bit and 32-bit installation paths, while on a 32-bit OS, only 32-bit paths are checked. The issue often arises due to insufficient detection mechanisms for distinguishing between these installations. Ensuring correct registry checks can prevent inconsistencies and improve patch management for Adobe products.",
