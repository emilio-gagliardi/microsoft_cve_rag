  "symptom_label": "windows_1511_version_stopped_reception_of_updates",
  "description": "Windows version 1511 has ceased to receive updates, thereby no longer being offered new feature enhancements or security improvements. Users running this version may experience vulnerabilities due to outdated software lacking support, which could expose them to threats. Transitioning to version 22h2 is necessary to access the latest updates and maintain system security. This is comparable to the transition from Windows 7 to Windows 10, highlighting a significant gap in update availability. System administrators should ensure that migration paths to current Windows editions are in place to avoid running unsupported builds, especially as the associated KB Article is currently unknown, necessitating further research.",
