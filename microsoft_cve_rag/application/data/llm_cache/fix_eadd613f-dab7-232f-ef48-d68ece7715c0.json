  "description": "**Fix Overview**:\n\nTo address vulnerabilities related to BitLocker protection on Windows recovery partitions:\n\n1. Confirm which recovery partition is currently in use by running the following command in PowerShell:\n   ```powershell\n   reagentc /info\n   ```\n\n2. Utilize a third-party tool like MiniTool Partition Wizard to evaluate the free space on your recovery partition and explore options for resizing it.\n\n**Details**:\n- Ensure you have at least 250MB of free space on the recovery partition to apply the update.\n- It is recommended to maintain at least a 1GB recovery partition for better management in future updates.\n- The recovery partition's location may affect its ability to be resized easily, depending on whether it is positioned before or after the C drive.
