  "description": "Authenticated users connecting to a malicious SQL Server via OLE DB encounter unresponsiveness in their SQL client application. Users may notice erratic behavior including application crashes or unexpected termination when their SQL client attempts to process specially crafted replies from the compromised SQL Server. This issue affects various Windows Server builds, including those noted in KB articles such as KB5035858 and KB5035885, leading to potential data leakage and unauthorized access. It is critical to ensure that users remain vigilant against unauthorized SQL Server connections to mitigate these risks.",
