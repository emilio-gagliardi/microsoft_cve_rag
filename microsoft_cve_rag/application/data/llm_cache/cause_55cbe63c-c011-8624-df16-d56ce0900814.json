  "description": "The root of the issue appears to be related to outdated UEFI firmware versions. Specifically, updating the UEFI and Intel Management Engine (ME) firmware from the 2023 version to the February 2024 version has resolved the problem for managed devices, particularly those manufactured by Dell. The issue had what seemed to be an abrupt failure, indicating that the firmware mismatch or bug led to security or operational instability. The relevant observation is captured in the KB article KB4074159, although further documentation would enhance traceability. This highlights the importance of timely firmware updates and their direct impact on device security and performance.",
