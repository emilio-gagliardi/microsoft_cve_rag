  "description": "End users may experience unauthorized access to sensitive data or system functionality after security updates related to CVE-2024-30049. Systems running affected builds, including Windows 10 Version 21H2 for x64-based systems (10.0.19044.4412) and Windows 11 Version 22H2 for x64-based systems (10.0.22621.3593), could see intermittent cases where privileges appear escalated, allowing unauthorized alterations of system settings. Users might observe anomalies in file access permissions, leading to an inability to perform certain administrative tasks. Additionally, these issues could manifest as unexpected behavior in applications that rely on defined access control settings. If such conditions are noted, immediate attention is warranted, as they might indicate an exploit of the underlying vulnerability detailed in KB5037768 and the related articles.",
