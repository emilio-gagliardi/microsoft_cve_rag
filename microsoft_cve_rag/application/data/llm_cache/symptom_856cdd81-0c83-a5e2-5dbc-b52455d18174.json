  "description": "After applying the security update KB-5039212 on affected systems, including Windows 10 builds 19043.4529, 22631.3737, 22621.3737, and 22000.3019, users may experience elevation of privilege on the Microsoft streaming service. This situation could lead to unauthorized access where a low-privileged attacker leverages the weakness through local interaction or by tricking a legitimate user into executing harmful commands. The observable behaviors resulting from this could be unauthorized changes to system settings or files, increased access to sensitive resources, and potential disruption of service availability. Administrators should monitor their environments closely following the update to ensure that no unauthorized access is taking place and that the integrity of systems is maintained.",
