  "description": "**Fix Overview**:\n\nTo resolve issues when your Surface Pro is unable to boot due to BitLocker encryption:\n\n1. **Try Basic Troubleshooting**: Power down the device completely and then power it back on. This might not resolve the issue, but it's a simple step to start with.\n\n2. **Check Microsoft Account**: Ensure you attempt to access your Microsoft account as the BitLocker recovery key may be saved there. Regaining access to this account can be critical in retrieving the recovery key.\n\n3. **Retrieve BitLocker Recovery Key**: If you regain access to your Microsoft account, follow the instructions located [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/windows/finding-your-bitlocker-recovery-key-in-windows-6b71ad27-0b89-ea08-f143-056f5ab347d6) to find your BitLocker recovery key. Input the recovery key when prompted, and your Surface Pro should be able to boot normally.\n\n**Important Considerations**:\n- If you have no way to regain access to your Microsoft account or have not saved or printed the BitLocker recovery key, you'll have to consider reinstalling Windows, which may result in data loss for any files not backed up elsewhere.\n",
