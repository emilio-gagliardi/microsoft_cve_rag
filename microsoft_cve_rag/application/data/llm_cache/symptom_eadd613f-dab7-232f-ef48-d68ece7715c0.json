  "description": "The Windows recovery partition is vulnerable, allowing an attacker to boot under the operating system and gain access to data stored on a BitLocker protected hard drive. This issue particularly affects older Windows 10 installations where the recovery partition is small and located next to the C drive, making it difficult to resize. To address this, the update associated with KB5034441 requires a minimum of 250MB of free space and highlights the importance of ensuring a larger recovery partition size in future installations.",
