  "description": "The underlying cause of the installation failure in Windows 10 was identified as a 'CBS source missing' issue. This problem prevented the system from finding the necessary files for a successful update process. Users attempting to repair the installation through various methods, including standard Windows Update repairs, were unsuccessful due to this misconfiguration. As a workaround, the user had to rely on an ISO file and the setup.exe for an in-place upgrade to restore functionality. This issue is particularly critical as Windows 10 is not currently listed as affected on the release health page, leading to potential confusion among administrators and users trying to troubleshoot such failures.",
