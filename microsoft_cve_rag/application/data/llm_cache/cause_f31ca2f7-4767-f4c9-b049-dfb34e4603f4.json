  "description": "The root cause of CVE-2023-36427 is linked to a flaw in the Hyper-V component within specific build versions of Windows operating systems. It allows an attacker with low privileges to escalate their permissions to system-level privileges. The vulnerability exists because the vulnerable component is not bound to the network stack, enabling local exploitation through read/write/execute capabilities. Specifically, exploitation could occur when an attacker accesses the target system via local means such as a keyboard or console, or remotely through protocols like SSH, requiring no user interaction. The impacted builds include Windows 10 (versions 21H2, 22H2) and Windows 11 (versions 21H2, 22H2, and 23H2) with associated KB articles KB-5032189, KB-5032190, KB-5032196, and KB-5032192, among others.",
