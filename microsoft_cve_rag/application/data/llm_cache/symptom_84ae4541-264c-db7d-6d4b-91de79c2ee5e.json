  "description": "End users or system administrators may observe that sensitive information is accessible from the Microsoft Local Security Authority (LSA) server due to an information disclosure vulnerability. This could manifest in the form of unauthorized access to memory that contains sensitive data, potentially allowing attackers to read small portions of stack memory that should remain confidential. Affected systems include Windows 11 Version 24H2 (KB5041571) and various builds of Windows 10 up to Version 21H2, affecting both x64 and 32-bit versions. The impact is significant as it poses a direct risk to the integrity of protected user data; hence, administrators should monitor their environments closely to detect any unusual access patterns. The vulnerability is considered important with a CVSS score indicating confidential information loss, highlighting the critical nature of applying the provided updates in a timely manner.",
