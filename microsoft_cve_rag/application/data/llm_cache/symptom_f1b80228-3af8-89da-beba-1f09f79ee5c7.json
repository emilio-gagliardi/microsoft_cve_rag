  "description": "After applying updates related to the Windows Telephony Server, users may observe unexpected behavior such as intermittent application crashes and issues related to privilege elevation for specific processes. Specifically, systems running on build numbers 10.0.19045.4291, 10.0.19044.4291, and earlier versions may experience functionality disruptions that affect user permissions. Administrators may find that certain applications behave incorrectly or fail to launch, leading to a frustrating experience for end users. These impacts may escalate based on the installed KB Articles, including KB-5036925, which address this important issue. Overall, users are likely to report a decline in the stability of service following the installation of these patches.",
