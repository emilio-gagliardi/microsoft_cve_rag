  "description": "The cause of CVE-2023-5474 stems from a heap buffer overflow vulnerability present in the Chromium open source software. This specific flaw can lead to memory corruption and potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code through crafted PDF documents. Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) integrates this library, making it susceptible to the same issues unless updated. The affected build numbers were 118.0.2088.46, which have since been rectified in the latest security update. The resolution highlights that, through coordinated vulnerability disclosure, Microsoft Edge can mitigate the risk posed by this flaw as outlined in KB-118.0.2088.46.",
