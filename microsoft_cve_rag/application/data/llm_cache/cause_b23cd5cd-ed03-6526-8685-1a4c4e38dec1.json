  "description": "The root cause of CVE-2023-36011 is attributed to a flaw in the win32k component, which allows for elevation of privilege under certain conditions. This vulnerability emerges from improper access control mechanisms that are exploited locally or through deceptive user interactions. Specifically, an attacker with basic user privileges can manipulate this flaw to gain system-level access to sensitive resources. This affects several Windows build numbers, including 10.0.10240.20345, 10.0.22000.2652, 10.0.19045.3803, and 10.0.22631.2861. The associated KB articles for this issue include KB-5033379, KB-5033375, KB-5033372, and KB-5033369, which provide necessary remediation steps for affected systems.",
