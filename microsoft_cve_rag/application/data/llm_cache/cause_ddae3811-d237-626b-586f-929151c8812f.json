  "description": "Insufficient data validation in the installer of Google Chrome on Windows prior to version 128.0.6613.84 allowed a local attacker to exploit this flaw through a crafted symbolic link, leading to privilege escalation risks. This issue is rooted in the handling of symbolic links during installation processes, which did not adequately verify the authenticity of the data before executing actions that could elevate access privileges.",
