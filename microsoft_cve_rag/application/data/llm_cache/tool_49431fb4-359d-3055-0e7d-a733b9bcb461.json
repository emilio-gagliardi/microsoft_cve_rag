  "description": "**Tool Overview**:\n\nThe 'audio manager' refers to the installed software or app that controls audio settings on a Windows device.\n\n**Details**:\n\nThis tool manages audio features like notifications for devices such as microphones, headphones, and speakers. When audio devices are connected, the pop-up dialog provides options to choose how the system should respond to these connections. Users can select 'remember my selection' to avoid seeing the dialog in the future, which helps streamline audio management. The behavior of this applet is influenced by the autoplay settings configured in the system, providing further customization for media interactions.\n\n**Usage Examples**:\n- Ensure that the audio manager is installed to take advantage of these features.\n- Configure autoplay settings under the control panel for enhanced functionality.",
