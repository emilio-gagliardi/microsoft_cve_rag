  "description": "An out-of-bounds read flaw in the Windows Distributed File System (DFS) allows an attacker to disclose sensitive information by exploiting memory access errors. This vulnerability stems from improper validation of input data, specifically allowing unauthorized reading of memory outside the intended buffer boundaries, which can lead to the exposure of confidential information that should be restricted.",
