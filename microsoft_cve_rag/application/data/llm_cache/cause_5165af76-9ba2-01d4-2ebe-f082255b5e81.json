  "description": "The underlying cause of the denial of service is an out-of-bounds read in the Windows Network Address Translation (NAT) service. This flaw allows an attacker to exploit the network stack, leading to a complete loss of availability as the service can be rendered inoperable, either during the attack or persistently afterwards. Exploitation requires knowledge of the specific conditions of the target environment, making it complex but possible remotely.",
