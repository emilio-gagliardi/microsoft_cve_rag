  "description": "The new Azure Active Directory Sync (ADSync) has a prerequisite of .NET Framework 4.7.1 for installation. However, when an upgrade to .NET Framework 4.7.2 is attempted, there may be compatibility issues depending on the server environment, particularly if ADSync is being run on a Domain Controller (DC). This raises potential security concerns that necessitate the migration of ADSync from the DC to a non-DC system. Failing to adhere to the specified .NET requirements can lead to functional disruptions within the synchronization process, resulting in user synchronization failures or inconsistencies across the directory services.",
