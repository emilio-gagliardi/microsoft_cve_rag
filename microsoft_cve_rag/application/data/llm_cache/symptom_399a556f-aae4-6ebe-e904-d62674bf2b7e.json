  "description": "After installing security update KB-5039330 on Windows Server 2022 and 23H2 editions, users may experience unauthorized access to system resources if a local attacker successfully exploits previously identified elevation of privilege vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities potentially allow an attacker who logs onto the system to run specially crafted applications, which could lead to executing actions with the same privileges as the compromised process. This situation raises serious concerns regarding the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive information on affected systems. The impact could result in further system compromise and unauthorized actions within the network. System administrators should monitor user activity closely for signs of such exploitation following the update.",
