  "description": "In certain environments, the patch identified by KB-5037765 is not presented as an available update for Windows Server 2019 systems. Although the patch can be manually downloaded and installed successfully from the Windows Catalog, it appears to be a detection issue potentially related to the WSUS settings or the specific configurations of those environments. Administrators may notice discrepancies in the expected patch availability leading to inconsistent patch management practices. This detection problem could affect overall update compliance and security posture since patches may not be automatically offered as intended. Similar reports from other users also indicate that this issue is not isolated, which may contribute to broader visibility and awareness within the system administration community.",
