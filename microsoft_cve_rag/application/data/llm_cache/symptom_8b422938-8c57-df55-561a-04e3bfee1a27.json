  "description": "When managing printers on Windows systems, administrators may encounter issues if they attempt to correct settings across all user sessions without running the necessary tool as the Local System account. Tools like PsExec and the Windows Task Scheduler can facilitate running commands under this account to ensure proper execution. Conversely, when end users manage their own printers, they must utilize administrative credentials to run the tool correctly to avoid access issues, which could lead to ineffective printer management.",
