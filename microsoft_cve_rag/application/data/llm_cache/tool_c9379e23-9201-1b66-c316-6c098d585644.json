  "description": "**Tool Overview**:\n\nThis tool allows administrators to change the owner of a device within the Intune environment either through the Intune console or via Microsoft Graph API.\n\n**Details**:\n\n1. **Intune Console**: Administrators can navigate to the Intune console, select the desired device, and change its ownership through the user interface. This process involves locating the device in question, accessing its properties, and selecting a new owner from the list of available users.\n2. **Microsoft Graph API**: For more automated or programmatic approaches, the Microsoft Graph API can facilitate owner changes. This requires knowing the correct API endpoints and having appropriate permissions set up within Azure Active Directory.\n3. **Reusability**: The method used for changing ownership can be documented and reused across multiple devices, thereby streamlining administrative processes.\n4. **Compliance**: Keeping device ownership correct is key for maintaining compliance and proper user access control.\n5. **Scalability**: This tool supports scaling to manage large numbers of devices effectively, reducing manual overhead.\n",
