  "description": "End users may experience a significant risk associated with Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ) that could potentially lead to remote code execution. Affected users running specific builds of Windows 10, including versions 19045.4291, 19044.4291, 22631.3447, 22000.2899, 22621.3447, and 10240.20596, might notice unusual system behaviors, such as applications crashing unexpectedly or unauthorized access attempts being reported through security logs. The installation of affected KB articles (KB-5036925, KB-5036894, KB-5036893, KB-5036892) is advised to mitigate these risks. It is crucial for system administrators to monitor their environments closely for any signs of compromised application integrity within MSMQ. Users should also be attentive to any error messages or anomalies that may indicate a larger underlying issue with MSMQ functionalities.",
