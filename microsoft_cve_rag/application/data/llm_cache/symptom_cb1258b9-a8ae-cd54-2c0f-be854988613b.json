  "description": "End users may experience a significant risk if the Windows Line Printer Daemon (LPD) service is enabled on their systems, resulting in potential remote code execution. Users could observe unauthorized processes being initiated or the installation of malicious software without any interaction. Systems running affected builds, such as Windows 10 versions 21H2 (10.0.19044.4780) and 22H2 (10.0.19045.4780), as well as Windows 11 version 23H2 (10.0.22631.4037), are particularly susceptible to this issue outlined in KB articles 5041592, 5041585, and 5041580. If exploited, users might face unexpected application behaviors, such as unauthorized access to sensitive data and changes to system configurations. Therefore, system administrators are advised to disable the LPD service to mitigate this risk and ensure their environments remain secure.",
