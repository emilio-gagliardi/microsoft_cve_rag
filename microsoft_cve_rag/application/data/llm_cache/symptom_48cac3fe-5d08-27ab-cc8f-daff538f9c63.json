  "description": "When exploiting CVE-2024-37971, users may observe that the secure boot feature fails to protect the system as expected. This security feature bypass could potentially allow unauthorized changes or access at a system level, which would not be evident until after the attack has occurred. System administrators may find that certain secure applications or processes can be unintentionally modified or accessed due to this bypass, leading to increased risk of system compromise. Builds affected include Windows 10 Version 21H2/22H2 and Windows 11 Versions 21H2/22H2 with associated KB articles KB5040427 and KB5040442. This issue raises concerns about the overall integrity of the operating system, requiring immediate attention to ensure robust security measures are in place.",
