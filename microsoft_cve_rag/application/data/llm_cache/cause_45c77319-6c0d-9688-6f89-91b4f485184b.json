  "description": "The underlying cause of the reboot issue relates to the management of recovery keys in Azure AD and Microsoft accounts associated with the affected device. If any Microsoft account has ever interacted with the PC, it will store a recovery key linked to the account. This situation often arises during deployment, as the recovery key may be retained in the Azure Active Directory (Entra) of the original deployer. Consequently, users need to verify all potential Microsoft accounts related to the device to locate the requisite recovery key, which is necessary to unlock BitLocker encryption during reboot failures. Such complexities can lead to significant delays in system recovery if not addressed promptly, emphasizing the importance of thorough account management post-deployment.",
