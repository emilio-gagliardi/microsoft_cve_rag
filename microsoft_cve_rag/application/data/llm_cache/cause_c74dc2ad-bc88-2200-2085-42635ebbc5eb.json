  "description": "The issue arises from the upgrade process where a critical registry key necessary for the proper functioning of Credential Guard is wiped out during the transition from Windows 10 to Windows 11. This misconfiguration creates an environment where 'lsass.exe' becomes unable to authenticate users due to missing credential handling settings, leading to instant reboots. It has been observed that exporting the 'msv1_0' entries from a clean Windows 11 installation that does not have Credential Guard enabled and importing them into the affected system resolves this issue. Specifically, the keys under 'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\LSA\\MSV1_0' must be restored to reinstate the original credentials functionality. This circumstance indicates a systemic problem related to registry management during major OS upgrades, particularly impacting enterprise environments.",
