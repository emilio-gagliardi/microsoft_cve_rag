  "description": "Systems may exhibit a total loss of availability when affected by the Microsoft WS-Discovery denial of service issue outlined in the CVE-2024-38091. This malfunction affects several Windows versions, including build numbers 10.0.22631.3880, 10.0.22621.3880, and 10.0.19045.4651, as highlighted in KB Articles like KB-5040442 and KB-5040431. Users may notice an inability to access services or resources, with interruptions leading to continuous service denials. Consequently, new connections may fail, and existing services can become unresponsive while the underlying attack persists. The security update aims to mitigate these impacts, but users must ensure they apply the relevant patches to prevent prolonged downtime.",
