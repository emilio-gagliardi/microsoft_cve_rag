  "description": "The Waves Maxx audio software application fails to recognize an audio device when plugged into the laptop's audio jack. This issue is observed when using headphones with non-standard 3.5mm plugs which may contain inline microphones. Despite testing with both a standard 3-terminal headphone and a 4-terminal headphone/mic combo, the software does not respond. This suggests potential compatibility issues with the hardware configuration and the software, especially when the audio jack may also be malfunctioning. The problem was resolved by utilizing a 3.5mm to USB adapter, which enabled the Waves Maxx app to acknowledge the audio input correctly, indicating possible deficiencies in the laptop's audio port functionality.",
