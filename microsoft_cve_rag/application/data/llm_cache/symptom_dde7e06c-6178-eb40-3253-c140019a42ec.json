  "description": "After the application of the security update KB-5040442 on Windows 11 version 23h2, users may observe unexpected increases in user permissions, leading to an elevation of privilege. This issue can affect various Windows 10 and 11 builds including 10.0.22631.3880, 10.0.19045.4651, and 10.0.22000.3079. End users may notice that standard user accounts are able to access and modify settings or files that should be restricted, leading to potential data integrity risks. System administrators should monitor their environments for unusual activity that may signify the exploitation of this behavior. The severity assigned to this issue is 'important'.",
