  "description": "Within Windows Hyper-V environments, particularly observed in build numbers [10, 0, 19045, 4291], [10, 0, 19044, 4291], [10, 0, 22631, 3447], [10, 0, 22000, 2899], [10, 0, 22621, 3447], and [10, 0, 10240, 20596], users may experience an observable denial of service condition. This symptom manifests as the inability to maintain stable virtual machine performance, where either virtual machines intermittently freeze, become unresponsive, or fail to process requests effectively. This issue is exacerbated when specific workloads are present, leading to heightened user frustration as overall access to virtualized resources is hampered. Administrators should reference the associated Knowledge Base Articles (KB-5036925, KB-5036899, KB-5036896, KB-5036894, KB-5036893, KB-5036892) for further details and mitigation steps. Immediate attention is advised to resolve this important severity level issue and restore expected functionality.",
