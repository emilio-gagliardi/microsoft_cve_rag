  "description": "After connecting to a malicious SQL database using the SQL client application, users may experience unauthorized remote code execution. This behavior indicates that an attacker has successfully exploited the system, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data manipulation, or service interruption. Affected products include Windows Server versions 2008 through 2012 as well as SQL clients operating under Windows 10 (various builds). This situation can create significant risks for end users and administrators alike, resulting in high levels of vulnerability exposure. Users should refer to related KB articles, such as KB-5035858 and KB-5035854, for detailed remediation steps.",
