  "description": "End users may experience failed authentication attempts when accessing services that rely on Kerberos for authentication. This symptom is observable as an error message indicating credentials are not accepted or that the service is unavailable. The issue is particularly relevant for systems running Windows 10 builds 19045, 19044, 22631, 22000, and 22621, as documented in KB-5036925, KB-5036894, KB-5036893, and KB-5036892. As a result, users may be unable to log in, access shared resources, or authenticate to domain services, leading to significant disruptions in workflow and productivity. Administrators may need to apply patches to resolve the underlying issues described in the knowledge base articles associated with the affected builds.",
