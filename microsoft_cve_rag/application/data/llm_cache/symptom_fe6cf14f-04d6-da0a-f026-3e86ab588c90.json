  "description": "After the installation of the recent security updates related to the Windows USB Video Class System Driver, users may notice unusual behavior that could suggest an elevation of privileges to unauthorized users. This could manifest as unauthorized access to system-level processes or files, indicating that the driver may have been manipulated. This may also lead to scenarios where users experience unexpected system behavior, such as altered permissions or access levels that seem inconsistent with their usual settings. Systems running on the affected builds, including Windows 10 (various versions) and Windows 11, may exhibit these vulnerabilities following updates that address KB5046696 and related articles. It is crucial for system administrators to monitor their environments for any signs of privilege escalation attempts after applying these updates.",
