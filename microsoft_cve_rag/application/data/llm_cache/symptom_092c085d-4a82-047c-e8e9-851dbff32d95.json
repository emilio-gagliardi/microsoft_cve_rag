  "description": "After installing the security update KB-129.0.2792.79 for Microsoft Edge, users may experience unexpected crashes or system instability when attempting to browse web pages. This behavior stems from insufficient data validation issues in the underlying Chromium framework, impacting how the browser processes certain web content. Users might notice that Edge exits unexpectedly or fails to respond during critical tasks, leading to frustration and inefficiencies. Additionally, some users could report slow performance while navigating websites, indicating underlying issues related to the recent updates. These symptoms could severely affect productivity, especially in enterprise environments relying on the browser for day-to-day operations.",
