  "description": "After applying the security updates specified in KB5032190 and KB5032192, users may experience issues with elevation of privileges on Windows 11 for both x64-based (builds 10.0.22621.2715) and ARM64 systems. This can lead to unexpected behaviors when attempting to perform administrative tasks, resulting in access limitations. Such symptoms can severely impact user productivity and operational functionality as tasks requiring elevated permissions may fail to complete successfully.",
