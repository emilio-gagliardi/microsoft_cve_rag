  "description": "Users may experience unexpected behavior while using web applications in Microsoft Edge, which is based on the Chromium engine affected by the 'use after free' vulnerability (CVE-2024-9961). This could manifest as the browser crashing unexpectedly when engaging in specific user interface interactions that trigger the underlying issue. Additionally, navigation may become unreliable, with pages failing to load or rendering incorrectly. The impact is particularly noticeable in versions prior to 130.0.6723.58, with the confirmed fix implemented in Microsoft Edge version 130.0.2849.46 that was released on October 17, 2024. End users should ensure they are updated to the latest version to mitigate these issues and maintain optimal application functionality.",
