  "description": "After updating to the latest Windows security updates, users may notice an inability to enforce secure boot features on their systems. This symptom may manifest as a potential security risk, whereby devices do not adhere to the expected secure boot protocol, leading to possible unauthorized access or execution of untrusted software. Users may observe unexpected behavior relating to system security settings, indicating that the system's integrity is compromised. Such incidents could occur across systems running various builds, including Windows 10 and Windows 11, specifically noted in build numbers such as 10.0.22631.4317 and 10.0.26100.2033. The relevant KB articles that document this issue include KB5044285 and KB5044284, and they guide users on necessary updates to mitigate the risk associated with this bypass.",
