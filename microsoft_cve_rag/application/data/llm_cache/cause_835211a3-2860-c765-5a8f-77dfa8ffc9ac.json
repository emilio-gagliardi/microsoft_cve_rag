  "description": "An integer overflow in the Microsoft WDAC OLE DB provider for SQL Server can lead to remote code execution by allowing attackers to send specially crafted packets to a vulnerable component. The flaw occurs when accepted input values exceed the maximum allowed range, causing unintended behavior during processing, which can be exploited by an authenticated user connecting to a malicious SQL server.",
