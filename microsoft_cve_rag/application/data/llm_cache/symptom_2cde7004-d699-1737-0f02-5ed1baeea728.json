  "description": "Users may experience crashes or instability in Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) 126.0.2592.113 as a result of underlying issues linked to a use-after-free condition in the media streaming component. This symptom arises when specific UI gestures are engaged with crafted HTML content, leading to potential heap corruption and ultimately causing the browser to terminate unexpectedly. The problem is particularly noted in versions prior to 126.0.6478.182 and is documented in KB-126.0.2592.113. Users might also notice slowness or unresponsiveness before a crash occurs, compounding the negative experience. Monitoring event logs could help administrators pinpoint crash reports relevant to this behavior.",
