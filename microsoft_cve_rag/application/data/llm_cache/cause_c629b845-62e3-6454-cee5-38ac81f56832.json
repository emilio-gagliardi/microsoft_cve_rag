  "description": "The underlying technical condition leading to CVE-2023-36017 is a memory corruption vulnerability in the JScript9 scripting engine of the Windows operating system. This flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected systems by tricking a user into accessing a crafted web server or shared resource, thus exploiting the vulnerability via user interaction. The affected product build numbers include various versions of Windows 11 and Windows Server, such as 10.0.22621.2715, 10.0.19043.3693, and 10.0.10240.20308, as well as server installations with specific KB article IDs (KB-5032199, KB-5032192, KB-5032190, KB-5032189). The flaw exploits the security mechanisms of the scripting engine, leading to potential loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability in the components managed by the same security authority.",
