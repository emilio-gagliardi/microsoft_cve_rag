  "description": "**Fix Overview**:\n\nTo resolve the issue with Google Chrome on Server 2022, where the application starts completely white and closes after approximately 30 seconds, follow the steps below to delete a specific registry key.\n\n1. Open an elevated command prompt (Run as Administrator).\n2. Execute the following command to delete the problematic registry key:\n\n```bash\nreg.exe delete \"hklm\\software\\microsoft\\windows nt\\currentversion\\image file execution options\\chrome.exe\" /f\n```\n\n**Details**:\nThis command removes the registry entry that may be causing Chrome to fail to launch properly on Server 2022 after the application of the February update (KB5034129). Deleting this registry key should restore functionality to Google Chrome across all versions. It is recommended to back up the registry before making any deletions. \n",
