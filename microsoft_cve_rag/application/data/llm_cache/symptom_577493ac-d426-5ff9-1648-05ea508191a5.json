  "description": "After the deployment of the security update due to CVE-2024-43636, users may experience unexpected elevation of privilege that could allow unauthorized access to sensitive system features or resources. This behavior can lead to normal user accounts gaining higher system privileges without appropriate authorization, resulting in critical security breaches. Affected systems include Windows Server 2025, Windows Server 2016, and older versions, with build numbers 10.0.26100.2314 and 10.0.14393.7515 among others. As outlined in KB articles KB-5046617 and KB-5046682, potential impacts could disrupt the standard operation of user and administrative privileges, presenting both immediate and long-term risks to data integrity and confidentiality.",
