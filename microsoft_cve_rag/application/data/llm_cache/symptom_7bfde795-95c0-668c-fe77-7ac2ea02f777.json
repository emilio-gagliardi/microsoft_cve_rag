  "description": "After the installation of KB5034129, users of chromium-based internet browsers such as Microsoft Edge may experience issues where the browser fails to open correctly. These browsers might present a white screen upon launch and subsequently become unresponsive, indicating a significant usability impairment. This symptom has been linked to specific Windows registry entries related to browser-specific Image File Execution Options (IFEO). If entries for Microsoft Edge (msedge.exe) or other chromium-based browsers exist in the registry, which may occur due to development tools or certain debugging and diagnostic settings, the described behavior is likely to manifest. This is reflected in the known issues list associated with KB5034770 as found in the Microsoft support documentation.",
