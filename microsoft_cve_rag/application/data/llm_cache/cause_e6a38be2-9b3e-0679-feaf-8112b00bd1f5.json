  "description": "The win32k.sys driver contains a heap-based buffer overflow flaw that can be exploited by a local attacker to gain elevated privileges on affected Windows systems, including Windows 10 and Windows Server versions. The issue arises from improper handling of memory allocation, allowing attackers to manipulate the memory space and execute arbitrary code with higher privileges.",
