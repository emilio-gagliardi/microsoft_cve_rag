  "symptom_label": "elevation_of_privileges_in_windows_kernel_mode",
  "description": "After applying the security update (KB5040442), users may experience unauthorized elevation of privileges on systems running Windows 11 (version 23H2 and 22H2) and Windows 10 (version 22H2 for both x64 and 32-bit systems). This elevation may allow attackers to gain higher administrative capabilities than intended, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data and system settings. Affected builds include Windows 10 (10.0.19045.4651) and Windows 11 (10.0.22631.3880). System administrators should closely monitor their environments for unusual activity post-update as these vulnerabilities can often be exploited without any user interaction, leading to a serious breach of security when combined with other threats. The severity of this issue is classified as important, highlighting the risk posed to system integrity after installation of the updates.",
