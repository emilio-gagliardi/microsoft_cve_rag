  "description": "A heap-based buffer overflow in the Windows Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS) allows remote code execution, which can be exploited without user interaction over a network. The vulnerability exists due to improperly managed memory allocation, enabling an attacker to send crafted requests that lead to execution of arbitrary code on the affected system.",
