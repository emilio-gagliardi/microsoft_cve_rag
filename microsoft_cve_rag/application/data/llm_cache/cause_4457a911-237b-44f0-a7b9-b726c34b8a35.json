  "description": "The underlying issue arises from known firmware issues with HP devices that utilize Sure Start Security. These devices require timely installation of the latest firmware updates from HP to properly implement secure boot updates. Without these critical firmware updates, users may face boot management problems when dealing with revocations related to secure boot changes. The failure to install the necessary firmware updates can lead to vulnerabilities and instability in the system's boot process. For more detailed guidance and information, users can refer to KB-5025885, which outlines how to manage Windows boot manager revocations for secure boot changes.",
