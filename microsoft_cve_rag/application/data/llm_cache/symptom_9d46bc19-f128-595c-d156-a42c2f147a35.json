  "description": "After updating to SSMS version 20.1, users may experience a requirement to reboot their systems due to the installation of the latest Microsoft ODBC driver version 17.10.6.1 and Microsoft OLE DB driver version 18.7.2. This behavior is likely a result of the new versions being installed, which may conflict with older driver versions that are already present on the system. The need for a reboot could disrupt workflow, especially in environments where SQL Server Management Studio is critical for daily operations. Users should be prepared for this potential disruption and check for the latest drivers specified in the release notes to ensure compatibility. For further information, users are advised to refer to the individual release notes for the Microsoft ODBC and OLE DB drivers for additional details.",
