  "description": "The underlying cause of CVE-2024-21305 is a flaw in the Hypervisor-Protected Code Integrity (HVCI) security feature on specific Microsoft Surface hardware. This issue arises when Windows operating systems incorrectly allow certain kernel-mode memory pages to be marked as read, write, and execute (RWX) despite HVCI being enabled. This misconfiguration of memory protection settings allows an attacker with administrative privileges to execute specially crafted applications that exploit signed drivers, thereby bypassing code integrity protections within Windows. As a result, these exploitable Surface devices, particularly those still in support, may face significant integrity risks due to the ability to modify essential files protected by HVCI. The devices affected include several models of Microsoft Surface that have not received updates, allowing the exploitation of this vulnerability.",
