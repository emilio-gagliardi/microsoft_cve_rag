  "description": "After applying the security update associated with KB-5036925, users may notice unauthorized access attempts to sensitive database information. Systems running on Windows build versions [10, 0, 19045, 4291], [10, 0, 19044, 4291], and older builds may exhibit increased network traffic from unexpected IP addresses. Administrators have reported irregularities in log files indicating data manipulation activities, which were previously normal before the patch. This behavior is particularly concerning for environments utilizing Microsoft WDAC OLE DB Provider for SQL Server, as it could facilitate potential data breaches if not monitored closely. Users should monitor for these symptoms promptly to safeguard data integrity across affected systems.",
