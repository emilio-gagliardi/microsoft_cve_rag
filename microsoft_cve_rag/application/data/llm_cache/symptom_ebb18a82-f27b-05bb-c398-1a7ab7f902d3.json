  "description": "After the installation of security updates KB5041571, KB5041585, KB5041580, and KB5041592 for Windows 10 and Windows 11, users may experience an elevation of privilege issue specifically affecting build numbers 10.0.19044.4780 and 10.0.26100.1457. This could manifest as unauthorized access to system resources or the ability for non-privileged users to gain higher system permissions, leading to potential security risks. End users may notice that applications or processes are running with escalated privileges unexpectedly, which compromises the integrity of system configurations. System administrators are alerted to unusual permission changes or unexpected functionality in applications that rely on user permissions, thus challenging the overall security posture of the environment.",
