  "description": "**Fix Overview**:\n\nTo resolve headphone recognition issues on Windows 11:\n\n1. Utilize a 3.5mm to USB adapter to connect the headphones to the laptop.\n2. Ensure the headphones have a standard 3-terminal plug instead of a 4-terminal plug if compatibility issues arise.\n\n**Details**:\n- The 3-terminal plug is commonly recognized by devices, whereas the 4-terminal plug indicates the presence of a microphone, which may lead to recognition problems with certain software like Waves Maxx.\n- Testing both types of headphones can confirm whether the audio jack or configuration is the source of the issue.\n\nIf problems persist, consider further troubleshooting on the laptop's audio jack or reassess the software settings in the Waves Maxx app.",
