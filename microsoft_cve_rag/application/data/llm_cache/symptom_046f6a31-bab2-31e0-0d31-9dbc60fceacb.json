  "description": "End users may experience unintended escalations of user privileges after executing PowerShell scripts or commands. This issue is prevalent in Windows 11 build numbers 10.0.26100.1742, 10.0.22631.4169, and earlier versions such as 10.0.22000.3197. Users with limited permissions may find themselves with enhanced capabilities, potentially allowing unauthorized access to sensitive files and system settings. As a consequence, system administrators need to address this behavior immediately to prevent compromise of user roles, as detailed in KB articles 5043080, 5043076, and 5043067. This behavioral alteration raises significant concerns about data integrity and system security, highlighting the importance of regular updates and patches to mitigate risks effectively.",
