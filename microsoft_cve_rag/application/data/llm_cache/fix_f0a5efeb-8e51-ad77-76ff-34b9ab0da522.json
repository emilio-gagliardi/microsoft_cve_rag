  "description": "To enhance troubleshooting capabilities when server failures occur after patching, consider integrating more robust logging features within Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager (MECM) and Windows Server Update Services (WSUS). These enhancements should focus on providing clearer error messages and detailed logs that can directly indicate the cause of failures rather than cryptic information that often requires extensive searching. Utilizing stop error codes alongside improved logging capabilities will streamline issue identification and resolution, allowing system administrators to proactively address patch-related issues. This approach reduces downtime and facilitates faster recovery by leveraging refined log data during the patch management process.",
