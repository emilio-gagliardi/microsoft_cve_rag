  "description": "The cause of the blue screen issue observed with devices that apply signed Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) policies is directly linked to the application of update KB5040427. When these devices had signed WDAC policies in place, they encountered the blue screen error 0xc0000001 upon attempting to reapply the update after reversing the policy back to signed. This indicates a conflict between the update and the signed WDAC policies, as devices running these policies had been operating without issues prior to the update. The troubleshooting involved removing the update, changing the WDAC policies to unsigned, and confirming that reinstating the signed policies led to the same issue, substantiating that the update was incompatible with these policies rather than any misconfiguration in the WDAC settings themselves.",
