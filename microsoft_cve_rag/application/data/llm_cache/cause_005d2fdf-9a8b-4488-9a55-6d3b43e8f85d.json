  "description": "The vulnerability arises from a use-after-free condition in the Windows vmswitch component, where the memory allocated to objects is freed but still accessed by attackers. This flaw allows an attacker with low privileges in a Hyper-V guest to send crafted networking requests that trigger this condition, leading to arbitrary code execution on the host environment.",
