  "description": "**Fix Overview**:\n\nTo address the issue of the Microsoft Copilot app appearing in the installed apps list due to Edge updates:\n\n1. Wait for the upcoming release of Microsoft Edge, which will provide a resolution for the improper installation of the Copilot Chat Provider package.\n2. Ensure that devices not intended for Microsoft Copilot are updated, as the resolution will remove this component from those devices.\n\n**Details**:\n- This issue affects Windows 10 (version 22H2) and Windows 11 (versions 21H2, 22H2, and 23H2) alongside Windows Server 2022.\n- The installed component does not execute any processes or transmit data; it is solely preparative.\n- Keep an eye out for further updates regarding the full installation and enablement of Microsoft Copilot. This fix is essential to ensuring unnecessary applications do not clutter the installed apps list.  \n",
