  "description": "End users may experience unexpected behavior when querying the domain name service (DNS) on Windows Server systems. Specifically, systems running on Windows Server 2016, 2019, or 2022 (Server Core installation) could face remote execution issues due to the vulnerability described by CVE-2024-26223. It's important to note that the server may become unresponsive or exhibit abrupt failures in network connectivity when under attack. Administrators might also notice increased latency in DNS resolution or fail to connect to services that rely on DNS queries. This results in an inability to access critical network resources, thereby disrupting normal operations for users and IT personnel alike.",
