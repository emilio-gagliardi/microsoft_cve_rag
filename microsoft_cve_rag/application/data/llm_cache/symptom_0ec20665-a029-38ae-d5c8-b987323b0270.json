  "description": "Users may experience crashes or instability in Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) version 126.0.2592.56 or earlier, particularly after applying updates related to CVE-2024-5839. The inappropriate implementation in the memory allocator could lead to heap corruption, which manifests as unexpected closures of the browser or loss of session data. System administrators may find that some users report frequent browser terminations while navigating web pages, especially those utilizing embedded HTML content. This behavior can disrupt productivity and frustrate users who rely on efficient browser operation for their tasks. To mitigate these issues, it is essential that users upgrade their Edge browser to version 126.0.6478.57 or later, as documented in KB-126.0.2592.56, to ensure they are protected from this identified flaw and to restore normal functionality.",
