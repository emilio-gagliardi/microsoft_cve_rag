  "description": "The recent modification regarding the Copilot icon's positioning has led to a shift in the taskbar behavior. The icon is now prominently displayed on the far right of the system tray, enhancing accessibility to the Copilot pane. This change has also altered the default setting for the 'show the desktop' option in the taskbar's far-right corner, which defaults to off, requiring user intervention to re-enable it in the settings.",
