  "description": "Users may experience difficulties accessing the ISO download and product keys within the Microsoft 365 admin center. This issue arises when users are not properly logged in with their work accounts, which is required to gain access to these resources. When navigating to the billing section under the left menu, the options for ISO downloads could be hidden or unavailable, impeding the ability to manage and utilize necessary software products. The accessibility of these downloads is critical for maintaining up-to-date installations and ensuring that the environment is operating with the latest features and security patches. Users should verify their login credentials and ensure they are viewing the proper menu items to resolve this access issue.",
