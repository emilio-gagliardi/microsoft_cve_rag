  "description": "Users may experience unauthorized access to sensitive information due to the NTLM spoofing vulnerability (CVE-2024-30081). This could lead to instances where an attacker gains access to confidential data, undermining user privacy and security. As a result, users may notice unusual access patterns or receive unexpected prompts requesting sensitive credentials. The affected systems include Windows 11 versions (builds 22631.3880, 22621.3880) and Windows 10 (builds 19045.4651, 19044.4651), which are outlined in the corresponding KB articles (KB5040442, KB5040431, KB5040427). It is important to regularly monitor user accounts and permissions to mitigate the risk of such information exposure.",
