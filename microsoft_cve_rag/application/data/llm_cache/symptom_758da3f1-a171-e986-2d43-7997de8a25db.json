  "description": "After the installation of security updates related to CVE-2024-20699, systems running Windows Hyper-V may experience complete denial of service, leading to total unavailability of Hyper-V services. Administrators might notice that virtual machines hosted on the Hyper-V platform cannot be accessed or controlled, effectively leaving the virtual infrastructure unmanageable. Users attempting to start or connect to virtual machines could encounter persistent failures, which directly impacts productivity and potentially disrupts business operations. This symptom could arise across various builds, including Windows Server 2022, Windows 10, and Windows 11, identified by KB articles such as KB-5034121, KB-5034122, and KB-5034123. Mitigating this symptom requires the installation of the latest security patches issued by Microsoft to restore normal operations.",
