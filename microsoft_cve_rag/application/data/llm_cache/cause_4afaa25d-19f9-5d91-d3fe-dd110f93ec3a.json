  "description": "The vulnerability is rooted in the exposure of sensitive information through the Microsoft Message Queuing component, which falsely manages access to heap memory, allowing attackers to read sensitive data. The flaw is exacerbated by the lack of effective security boundaries that could isolate memory access, especially in low-privilege scenarios where minimal user interaction is needed. This vulnerability affects components on multiple Windows Server and Windows 10 versions, as outlined in the associated KB Articles.",
