  "description": "After updating the UEFI firmware and Intel ME Firmware, which includes Firmware Trusted Platform Module(FTPM), many managed devices, primarily Dell models, were no longer experiencing issues related to device security. The resolution occurred after transitioning from a 2023 UEFI build to a February 2024 UEFI version. Prior to the update, there were intermittent failures observed that seemed to arise suddenly. This issue was affecting the device security features critical for maintaining the integrity of the devices in a managed environment. The identified KB article related to this update is KB4074159, although further details on the specific nature of the issues are documented in a related post.",
