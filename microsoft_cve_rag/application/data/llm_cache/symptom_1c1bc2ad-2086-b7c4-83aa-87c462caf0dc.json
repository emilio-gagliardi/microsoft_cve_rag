  "description": "Users may experience crashes or instability when opening specially crafted PDF files in Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) versions prior to 128.0.2739.42. This behavior is a consequence of a heap buffer overflow vulnerability identified by CVE-2024-7973 in the underlying PDFium component of Chromium. Affected users may notice frequent application closures, unexpected error messages, or system unresponsiveness while attempting to read PDF documents. Upgrading to Microsoft Edge version 128.0.2739.42 resolves these issues and mitigates the risk associated with this vulnerability, as it ensures the application no longer exhibits these crashing behaviors. Refer to KB-128.0.2739.42 for detailed guidance on the update.",
