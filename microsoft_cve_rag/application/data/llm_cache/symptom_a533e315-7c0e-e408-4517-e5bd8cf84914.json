  "description": "Users may experience unexpected data deletion or modification due to potential privilege elevation on affected Windows systems. This issue arises when an attacker logs into the system and runs a specially crafted application that exploits the vulnerability. As a result, files that are targeted by the attacker may be deleted without authorization, leading to loss of critical data for users. The issue impacts various Windows products including Windows 10 and Windows 11 across multiple build numbers, specifically versions like 10.0.22631.3296 for Windows 11 and 10.0.19045.4170 for Windows 10. The relevant KB Articles include KB5035858 and KB5035845, which provide more information about the need for critical updates to address this risk.",
