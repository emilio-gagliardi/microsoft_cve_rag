  "description": "End users may observe that applications leveraging Windows graphics components become less secure due to potential elevation of privilege. This issue, highlighted in multiple Windows builds including 10.0.22631.4317 (Windows 11 Version 23H2) and 10.0.22000.3260 (Windows 11 Version 21H2), could enable unauthorized access rights, resulting in unanticipated behaviors when using graphical interfaces. User-initiated operations in applications may not operate as expected, allowing for actions that breach user security boundaries. Consequently, organizations should refer to the corresponding KB Articles (KB-5044285, KB-5044284, KB-5044280, and KB-5044273) for guidance on applying necessary updates to mitigate this risk effectively.",
