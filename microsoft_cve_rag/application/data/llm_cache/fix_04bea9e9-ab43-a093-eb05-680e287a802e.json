  "description": "**Fix Overview**:\n\nTo clarify the functionality and usage of Autopilot versus Intune:\n\n1. Understand that Autopilot does not image devices but instead automates the Out-of-Box Experience (OOBE) process and enrolls devices into Mobile Device Management (MDM).\n2. If traditional imaging is preferred, it can still be implemented regardless of using Autopilot or Intune configurations.\n3. Note that existing devices can be enrolled in Autopilot similarly to how they can be enrolled in Intune through Group Policy Objects (GPO).\n\n**Details**:\nBe sure to communicate the distinctions to your teams to avoid confusion. Emphasizing the roles of each tool will help streamline the device deployment processes effectively.",
