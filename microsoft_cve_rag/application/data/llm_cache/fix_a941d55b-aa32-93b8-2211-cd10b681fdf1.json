  "description": "**Fix Overview**:\n\nTo resolve the DC issue with out-of-band updates:\n\n1. Install the out-of-band (OOB) update specifically on the Domain Controllers (DCs) as recommended by Microsoft.\n2. Ensure that the OOB update is included in your update catalog, like Ivanti's Security Controls, for easy deployment.\n\n**Details**:\n- The DC issue should be permanently resolved with this update, and it will be included in upcoming monthly updates such as those for April.\n- The installation should be managed carefully to only target the DCs to avoid unnecessary disruptions.
