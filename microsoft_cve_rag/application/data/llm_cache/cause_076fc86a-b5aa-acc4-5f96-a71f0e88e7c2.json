  "description": "The issue is caused by the Microsoft AllJoyn API's use of uninitialized resources, allowing for potential information disclosure. This flaw arises because the API, which is vulnerable when bound to the network stack, improperly handles memory before it has been initialized, potentially exposing sensitive data to unauthorized network attackers, leading to a total loss of confidentiality of the affected system's resources.",
