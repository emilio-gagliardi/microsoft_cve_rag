  "description": "The underlying issue stems from the requirement that certain group policy settings must be applied prior to the installation of Microsoft Teams. Specifically, without enabling the group policy setting related to the 365 admx templates, users may face issues with the software not functioning as intended. This misconfiguration can prevent Teams from starting up correctly or applying necessary settings, leading to operational disruptions. Ensuring that this setting is enabled before installation is critical for optimal functionality. This highlights the importance of properly configuring group policies in enterprise environments to prevent software integration issues.",
