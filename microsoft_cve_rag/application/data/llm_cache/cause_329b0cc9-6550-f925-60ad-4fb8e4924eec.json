  "description": "The underlying cause inferred from the post is related to issues arising when patching the Hyper-V host on Windows Server 2019. The referenced KB articles, KB-5031364 and KB-5031361, suggest that recent updates may trigger performance problems within virtual machines (VMs) when the Hyper-V host is patched. The user has chosen to avoid patching the host to prevent triggering these issues, instead opting to patch the VMs only. This approach indicates the presence of a critical interaction between the updates and Hyper-V functionality that needs thorough investigation to identify an appropriate resolution. Additionally, a reference to a fix related to an RCT issue indicates there are known bugs affecting the interaction between Veeam and Hyper-V that contribute to this situation.",
