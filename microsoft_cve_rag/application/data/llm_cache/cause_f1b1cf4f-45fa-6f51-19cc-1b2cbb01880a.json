  "description": "The underlying cause of the migration issues arises from outdated Exchange Server installations that are no longer being updated. Specifically, the move from older versions of Exchange (20xx) to Exchange 2019 is crucial when utilizing the Windows Server 2022 Core installation option. This outdated configuration imposes risks and operational challenges, making maintenance and support complicated. The post hints at potential pitfalls associated with failing to adopt more recent versions or cloud solutions like Exchange Online, ultimately leading to increased costs and operational pain for administrators. Thus, timely migration and updates are pivotal for maintaining system integrity and performance.",
