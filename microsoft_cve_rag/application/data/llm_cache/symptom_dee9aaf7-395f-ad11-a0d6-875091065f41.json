  "description": "After applying the security updates for Windows systems, users may experience failures in executing applications that rely on the Windows Mobile Broadband Driver. This behavior is especially noticeable on Windows 10 and Windows 11 operating systems, specifically builds 10.0.22631.4317, 10.0.26100.2033, and other specified builds. In particular, systems may fail to establish or maintain network connections, leading to interruptions in service or unexpected application crashes. Users may observe increased error messages indicating that applications cannot load network resources, which may require a manual restart of the affected applications or even the entire system. The relevant KB articles for these updates are KB-5044285, KB-5044284, KB-5044280, and KB-5044273.",
