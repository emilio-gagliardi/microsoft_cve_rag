  "description": "**Tool Overview**:\n\nThis involves applying security updates to Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) to address the vulnerabilities outlined in CVE-2024-5499. Updates for Edge are tied to its underlying Chromium engine, meaning that when a Chromium vulnerability is patched, Edge receives the necessary updates as well. **Details**:\n\n- Microsoft Edge relies on the Chromium project, and as such, it must ingest updates that address Chromium vulnerabilities. \n- Regularly checking for and applying updates ensures that potential risks are mitigated. \n- Users can check the version of Edge they are using through the 'About Microsoft Edge' section in the browser.\n- Keeping Edge updated is essential for security, especially given the out-of-bounds write vulnerabilities that could potentially allow arbitrary code execution. \n- For detailed information about the security updates, users should refer to the official Google Chrome release notes for the specific versions that address the vulnerabilities.\n\n**Usage Example**:\n- To update Microsoft Edge, navigate to the menu (three dots in the upper right corner) > Help and feedback > About Microsoft Edge. Edge will automatically check for updates and apply them if available.",
