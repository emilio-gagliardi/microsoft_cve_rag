  "description": "After the relevant security patches are applied, users may experience an elevation of privilege in the Windows Telephony Server, particularly affecting builds including 10.0.19045.4291, 10.0.19044.4291, and others listed in the documentation. This issue can lead to unexpected behavior where users might gain access to restricted functionalities or find themselves with increased permissions unintentionally. Such occurrences are concerning from a security standpoint, as they can allow inappropriate access to sensitive system areas. The related KB articles, such as KB-5036925 and others, provide necessary updates to mitigate this vulnerability, enhancing overall system integrity and user access control. Administrators should ensure that all affected systems are updated to prevent unauthorized privilege escalations.",
