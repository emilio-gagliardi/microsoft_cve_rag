  "symptom_label": "domain_controllers_fail_authentication_with_authlite_module",
  "description": "The recently released 2024-06 cumulative update has caused domain controllers running on Server 2022 (KB5039227), Server 2019 (KB5039217), and possibly Server 2016 (KB5039214) to stop calling the AuthLite module. This failure leads to the breaking of authentication for all AuthLite users. Administrators should delay the installation of this update or utilize a one-factor break-glass emergency account for any necessary rollbacks. An investigation is currently underway to identify the changes within this update that led to this issue, which is suspected to be a mistake. Affected systems may face significant authentication failures until the underlying problem is resolved.",
