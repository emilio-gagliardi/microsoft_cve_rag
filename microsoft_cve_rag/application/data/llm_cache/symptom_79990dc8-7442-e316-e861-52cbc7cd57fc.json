  "description": "The Windows iSCSI service may become completely unavailable due to uncontrolled resource consumption when the system is subjected to specific network conditions. Users or system administrators might observe that iSCSI connections drop unexpectedly or fail to establish entirely. This impact could lead to critical disruptions in storage access, potentially resulting in inaccessibility of important data and applications relying on iSCSI storage. Affected build numbers include Windows 11 Version 23H2 (10.0.22631.3880), and corresponding KB articles include KB5040442. The impact of this issue has been classified with an important severity level, indicating it should be addressed promptly to restore normal operation of the service.",
