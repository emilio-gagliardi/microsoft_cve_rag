  "description": "The underlying technical condition causing the issue is a flaw in the Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) service, which is vulnerable to remote code execution when enabled. This vulnerability arises due to improper validation of DHCP messages, allowing an attacker on the same network segment to send specially crafted messages to the ICS service. The systems impacted include those with various builds of Windows such as 10.0.10240, 10.0.22000, and others as listed. Relevant KB articles for remediation include KB-5033379, KB-5033375, KB-5033372, and KB-5033369, which provide patches and fixes to address this vulnerability.",
