  "description": "Windows upgrades may fail due to insufficient space in the recovery environment or OS volume, particularly when hardware compatibility is problematic. This can be indicated by specific exit codes like 0xc1900200 during the upgrade process. Administrators should first ensure that the VM Tools are updated and utilize compatibility scans to detect issues. The recommended command for this is 'setup.exe /auto upgrade /quiet /noreboot /dynamicupdate disable /compat scanonly'. Such upgrade failures can impede system operation and require attention to these hardware and space-related considerations for successful installation. Related resources may provide additional guidance on resolving these space issues.",
