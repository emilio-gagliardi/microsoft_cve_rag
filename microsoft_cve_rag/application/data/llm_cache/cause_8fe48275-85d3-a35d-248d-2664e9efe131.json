  "description": "The vulnerability arises from an out-of-bounds read condition in the Windows USB Video Class system driver, which could allow unauthorized physical manipulation of USB devices to escalate privileges. This condition can be traced back to flaws in the driver's memory handling routines, specifically failing to correctly validate access to memory locations when handling data, leading to potential exploitation by an attacker with physical access to a vulnerable system.",
