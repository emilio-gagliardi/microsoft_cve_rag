  "description": "The observed symptom resulting from the Windows Network Address Translation (NAT) denial of service vulnerability (CVE-2024-43565) is a complete loss of service availability for applications reliant on NAT functionality. Users and system administrators may notice that they are unable to access network services or resources that depend on NAT, leading to significant disruptions in connectivity. This issue affects various builds of Windows including Windows Server 2022, Windows 11 versions 22H2, 23H2, and 24H2, as well as Windows 10 versions 21H2 and 22H2. The loss of service can be either persistent or sustained, affecting operations immediately following an exploit. The relevant KB articles providing patches and fixes are KB-5044284, KB-5044285, KB-5044280, and KB-5044273, highlighting the critical need for updates to mitigate this impact.",
