  "description": "The Windows 11 upgrade process has transitioned to requiring the PC Health App for users to initiate upgrades from older versions. This significant change in Microsoft\u2019s upgrade methodology creates challenges, particularly in managed environments where updates are controlled through IT policies. Administrators find that when trying to upgrade machines already running Windows 11, the app triggers an unnecessary validation process instead of allowing a straightforward upgrade. This leads to frustration as end users and IT staff must resort to downloading ISO files instead of using the direct upgrade option, complicating the update pathway for feature releases.",
