  "description": "Domain Administrators are encountering issues when attempting to rejoin computers to the domain due to restrictive Active Directory policies. Specifically, attempts to reuse a computer account are being denied by the enforcement behavior of the policy. Error messages logged include 'account re-use attempt was denied by active directory policy' and 'ldap creation failed'. The denials occur even for Domain Admins who should theoretically have the permissions to bypass such restrictions, indicating a broader issue with policy enforcement. This functionality seems to have unexpectedly changed since the enforcement was enabled a year ago, highlighting a potential misconfiguration in Active Directory policy settings.",
