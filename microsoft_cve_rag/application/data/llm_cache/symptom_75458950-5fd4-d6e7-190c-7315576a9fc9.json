  "description": "After updating to Microsoft Edge version 127.0.2651.74, users may experience crashes or instability in the browser. This observable behavior can manifest as unexpected closures of the browser window or the application becoming unresponsive during use. Users might note that these issues arise more frequently when navigating complex web pages or running multiple tabs simultaneously. The problem is directly associated with the underlying changes made in the Chromium OS, that Edge inherits, which were intended to address a specific security vulnerability. Therefore, while the aim of the update is to enhance security, the unintended impact may detract from user experience until further patches are introduced. The problem is further documented in KB article KB-127.0.2651.74.",
