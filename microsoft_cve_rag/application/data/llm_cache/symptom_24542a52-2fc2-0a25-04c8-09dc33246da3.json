  "description": "Users may experience prompts and warnings regarding potential elevation of privileges on systems running specific Windows builds. This symptom is prevalent after recent updates affecting Windows 10 versions 22H2 and 21H2 (builds 10.0.19045.3693, 10.0.22000.2600) and Windows 11 (builds 10.0.22621.2715). End users could notice abnormal behaviors or be forcibly reminded that changes requiring elevated permissions have been blocked.
