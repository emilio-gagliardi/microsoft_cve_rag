  "description": "The cause of the issue stems from the integration of Copilot within Microsoft Word in the Semi-Annual Channel. This service was introduced without adequate licensing for use in the environment where it was deployed, leading to potential operational conflicts or unsupported scenarios. Users may find that functionality related to the AI host is unexpectedly disabled or unlicensed, affecting workflows that depend on artificial intelligence features. The presence of this new service may create confusion regarding compatibility and operational capabilities. Additionally, the lack of detailed documentation or support regarding the new AI features could complicate effective usage and troubleshooting efforts.",
