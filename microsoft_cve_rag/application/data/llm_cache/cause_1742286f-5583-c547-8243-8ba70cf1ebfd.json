  "description": "The underlying issue stems from a change introduced in the October 2023 security update, KB5031356, specifically affecting Windows 10 (22H2) and Windows 11 (22H2). This update seems to trigger a failure of the User Profile Service, resulting in numerous temporary folders and sign-in issues where profiles cannot be loaded. Although efforts such as registry verification, SCF and DISM commands, and even uninstalling the update did not rectify the problem, creating a new user profile appeared to offer a temporary fix. The connection with McAfee antivirus settings also raises questions about potential conflicts, although no exclusions were indicated. Monitoring the persistence of the issue after these adjustments will be crucial to ascertain the stability of the user experience going forward.",
