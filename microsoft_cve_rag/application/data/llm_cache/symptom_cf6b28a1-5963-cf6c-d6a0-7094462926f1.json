  "description": "The Reporting Web Service encountered a failure, preventing it from functioning correctly. This issue was resolved through a comprehensive maintenance of the SUSDB and a subsequent restart of the WSUS pool. After performing these actions, reporting capabilities were restored and functioning as expected. The problem did not present itself previously, indicating a potential intermittent issue with the WSUS environment. This suggests a need for routine maintenance to avoid future disruptions in service delivery.",
