The affected components fall under the Windows platform, specifically versions identified by build numbers such as 10.0.22631.3007, 10.0.19045.3930, and 10.0.17763.5329, documented in KB articles KB-5034123, KB-5034122, and KB-5034127. An official fix is available to address this vulnerability, ensuring that users can be safeguarded from unauthorized device recognition and potential data compromise.",
