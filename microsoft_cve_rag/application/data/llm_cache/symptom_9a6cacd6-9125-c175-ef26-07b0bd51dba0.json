  "description": "System administrators may encounter situations where users of Surface Pro devices need to reinstall Windows 10 due to various underlying issues with the operating system or device performance. This symptom involves utilizing a specially created USB recovery drive to boot the Surface Pro and initiate the removal and reinstallation of Windows on the device's hard drive. Such issues can arise from corruption in the operating system files, configurations that lead to instability, or other software-related problems. Documentation on creating and using a USB recovery drive is available from Microsoft support, which provides guidance on the necessary steps to effectively restore the device. Troubleshooting such symptoms is essential for maintaining operational efficiency and user satisfaction in an enterprise environment.",
