  "description": "The cause of CVE-2024-38025 is attributed to a heap-based buffer overflow in the Microsoft Windows Performance Data Helper library, which allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code remotely. This vulnerability necessitates that the target system runs a performance counter collection tool, enabling the attacker with local administrative privileges on the attacker machine to execute malicious code through the performance monitor process. The flaw exists across several Windows build numbers, posing a risk of significant confidentiality and integrity loss.",
