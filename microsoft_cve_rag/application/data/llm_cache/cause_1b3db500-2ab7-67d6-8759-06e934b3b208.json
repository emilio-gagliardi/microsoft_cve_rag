  "description": "The CVE-2023-36036 vulnerability in the Windows cloud files mini filter driver is an elevation of privilege issue that affects Microsoft Windows 10 and later versions. It has a low complexity of exploitation, requiring only local access without high-level privileges or user interaction. An attacker exploiting this vulnerability can gain system-level privileges, which poses a significant risk, especially in cases where initial access has been achieved via phishing. Microsoft has classified this as a critical zero-day vulnerability with a CVSS score of 7.8, emphasizing the need for immediate updates to mitigate its exploitation in active attacks. Failure to install the recommended updates could lead to a compromise of system security and integrity.",
