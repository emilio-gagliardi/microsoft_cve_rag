  "description": "The underlying cause relates to the use of Azure Arc with on-premises servers running Windows Server 2012 R2, which could potentially lead to configuration challenges and recurring charges if not managed properly. Users are required to track the license carefully, as failing to do so might result in unintended subscription costs that are billed monthly. This post highlights the importance of actively managing subscriptions within Azure Arc to avoid these unexpected charges. Moreover, the integration of Azure services with legacy systems can introduce complexities that need to be addressed effectively to ensure a seamless experience. It's crucial for system administrators to be aware of the implications of such configurations to mitigate additional financial liability and ensure compliance with licensing agreements.",
