  "description": "The January 2024 Windows Recovery Environment update may fail to install on various Windows 10 versions, such as 21H2 and 22H2, due to insufficient space in the recovery environment's partition. This issue can trigger an error message indicating '0x80070643 - error_install_failure', preventing successful update installation. To address this, the WinRE partition must be resized to ensure a minimum of 250 megabytes of free space is available, as detailed in KB5028997.",
