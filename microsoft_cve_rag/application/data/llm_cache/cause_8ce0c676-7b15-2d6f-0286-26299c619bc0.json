  "description": "The cause of the remote code execution issue described by CVE-2024-20654 is a flaw in the Microsoft ODBC Driver, which allows attackers to exploit the system through a malicious SQL database connection. Specifically, the vulnerability arises when an authenticated user is tricked into connecting to a compromised SQL server using their SQL client application. This connection leverages networking protocols that may carry specially crafted packets designed to exploit the driver, leading to arbitrary code execution within the user's application context. The attack requires the user to take action by connecting to the malicious database, highlighting both the security risk posed by user interaction and the importance of client-side protections against such exploits. The products affected by this issue include multiple builds of Windows 10 and 11, as detailed in the metadata, including those with build numbers 10.0.19044.3930 and 10.0.22631.3007.",
