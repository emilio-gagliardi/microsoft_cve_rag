  "description": "The root cause of the server failures during patching is linked to insufficient logging provided by the Windows Update mechanism utilized within the Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager (MECM). While streamlined processes generally reduce the need for detailed log reviews, certain failures still expose the limitation of not having accessible error information. Particularly, when a patch fails, the stop error can sometimes provide sufficient data to identify the underlying issue or direct the administrator to relevant resources online. However, the reliance on cryptic logs can hinder rapid troubleshooting and resolution. Therefore, enhancing the integration of MECM and WSUS to supply clearer information may alleviate challenges posed by current logging practices.",
