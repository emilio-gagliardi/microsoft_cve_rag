{"description": "The Microsoft QUIC service is susceptible to a Denial of Service attack due to its reliance on the network stack. This vulnerability is partially attributed to the excess resource consumption that can occur from exploit attempts, affecting components across several builds, specifically Windows 11 versions 21H2 (10.0.22000.2538) and 22H2 (10.0.22621.2428) as noted in KB articles KB5031358 and KB5031354. When under attack, these services can experience significant availability issues, leading to total service disruptions, which represents a critical operational concern.", "cause_label": "ExcessResourceConsumptionVulnerabilityInNetworkStack", "source_id": "bb0123e0-7b91-92b6-87ee-c2252c0218d2", "source_type": "MSRCPost", "tags": ["Denial of Service", "QUIC", "Network Stack"], "node_label": "Cause", "node_id": "8c26ebd3-413e-491e-9b77-7b3a899c082e", "reliability": 0.9, "severity_type": "important"}
