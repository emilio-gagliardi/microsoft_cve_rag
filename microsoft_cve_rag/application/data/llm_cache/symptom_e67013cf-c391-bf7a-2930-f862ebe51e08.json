  "description": "End users may experience unexpected access to system privileges following the installation of updates related to the Windows Ancillary Function Driver for Winsock (CVE-2024-38193). When this vulnerability is exploited, it may result in unauthorized actions performed on the system, manifesting a noticeable privilege escalation behavior. Such an occurrence may not only compromise the security integrity of the affected systems, but also could lead to significant productivity losses as system administrators struggle with maintenance and recovery. Users on affected Windows 11 versions, including 24H2 (KB5041571) and prior builds (KB5041585, KB5041580, KB5041592), should remain vigilant to ensure the deployment of necessary security updates to prevent possible intrusions or unauthorized changes in their systems.",
