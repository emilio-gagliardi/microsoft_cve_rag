  "description": "The underlying cause of the VPN performance issue when running Windows 11 is likely related to the disabled state of the 'Routing and Remote Access' service. When users started allowing Windows 11 on laptops, they observed that VPN connectivity became significantly slower, suggesting that essential routing capabilities may not have been properly initialized. The troubleshooting hints imply that without this service actively enabled, the VPN's functionality would degrade, causing delays and connectivity interruptions. It's critical for system administrators to ensure that 'Routing and Remote Access' is configured and running on any devices utilizing Windows 11 for efficient VPN performance. Regular checks and configurations must be performed to avoid similar issues in future builds of Windows.",
