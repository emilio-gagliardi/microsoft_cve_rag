  "description": "End users may observe unauthorized access to functionalities or data on Windows workstations, particularly with affected builds such as 10.0.22631.3880 (KB5040442) and 10.0.19044.4651 (KB5040427). Reports indicate that after installation of the security updates, there are potential instances where a user with minimal privileges can gain higher access to resources, introducing significant security risks. This behavior is especially critical for systems operating on Windows 11 Version 22H2 or Windows 10 Version 21H2, potentially leading to compromised user data and system settings if not addressed. Administrators should ensure the installation of the latest patches to mitigate these issues urgently.",
