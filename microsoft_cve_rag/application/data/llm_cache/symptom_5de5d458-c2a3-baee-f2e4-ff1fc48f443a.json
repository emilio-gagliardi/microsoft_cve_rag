  "description": "Users of Azure Virtual Desktop may experience a black screen during the login process, which can be traced back to updates stemming from a non-security preview update released in July 2024. This issue, noted under Windows 10 version 22H2, affects users following the installation of KB-5040525 and KB-5045594. In addition to the persistent black screen, the error may manifest as application event logs showing Event ID 1000, indicating a fault with the 'svchost.exe_appxsvc' application. While Windows 10 Education and Home users are less likely to encounter this issue, enterprise environments utilizing Azure Virtual Desktop are more significantly impacted. The problem is resolved in updates released on October 22, 2024, and no special configuration is required for the resolution if the latest updates are applied.",
