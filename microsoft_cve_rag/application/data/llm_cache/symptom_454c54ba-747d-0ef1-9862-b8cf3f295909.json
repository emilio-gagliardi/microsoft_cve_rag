  "description": "The DHCP server experiences denial of service, leading to significant network outages. This issue impacts Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019 across their respective builds, specifically noted in KB-5039260. System administrators may observe that clients are unable to obtain IP addresses, causing them to lose connectivity to the network. As a result, websites and internal resources become unreachable, leading to disruptions in workflow for end users. This symptom underscores the critical nature of maintaining DHCP server availability, particularly in environments relying heavily on dynamic addressing.",
