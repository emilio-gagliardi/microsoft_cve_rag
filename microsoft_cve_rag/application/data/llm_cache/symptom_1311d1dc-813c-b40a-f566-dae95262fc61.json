To address this and restore functionality, Microsoft released the KB5040442 cumulative update, which includes thirty-one improvements, ultimately restoring the 'Show Desktop' button. This update is crucial for users who heavily rely on this feature for multitasking and efficient navigation on their Windows 11 systems. It is recommended to apply the patch promptly to ensure optimal user experience and accessibility.",
