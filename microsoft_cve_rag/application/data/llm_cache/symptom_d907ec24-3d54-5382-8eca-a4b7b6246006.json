  "description": "After updating to Microsoft Edge version 128.0.2739.79, users may experience freezing or unresponsive behavior when attempting to navigate certain web pages. This observable issue arises due to a heap buffer overflow vulnerability that was recently addressed in version 128.0.6613.137 of the Chromium engine, which powers Edge. The updated version mitigates any previously existing instability related to the flaw in the underlying web rendering engine. However, users who haven't completed the update process might still face these performance issues, resulting in frustration during web browsing. The issue is part of the broader impacts noted in KB-128.0.2739.79 pertaining to system performance after security-related updates.",
