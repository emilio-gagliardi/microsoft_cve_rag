  "description": "End users running Windows Server 2008 R2, 2012, and 2012 R2 may experience unauthorized remote code execution on their machines due to the Windows Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS). The issue particularly affects the systems with build numbers such as 10.0.19045.4412, 10.0.22631.3593, and earlier versions, and users may find that their applications behave unexpectedly or crash when malicious network activity exploits this flaw. Relevant KB articles such as KB-5037788 and KB-5037771 outline the potential for attackers to gain control of systems over the network, leading to a compromised operating environment and potential alterations to data integrity. This vulnerability can have serious implications for the systems' availability and confidentiality, as unauthorized code execution may result in data theft or system downtime.",
