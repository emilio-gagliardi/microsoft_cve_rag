  "description": "Users of Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) version 118.0.2088.46 may experience observable behaviors related to instability, such as application crashes or unexpected closures while browsing. This symptom arises from a use-after-free condition caused by the underlying Chromium software, as detailed in KB-118.0.2088.46.
