  "description": "The underlying cause of the issue pertains to a vulnerability related to the Windows recovery partition, specifically affecting versions outlined in KB5034441. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by booting under the operating system, thereby gaining unauthorized access to the BitLocker protected hard drive. The problems arise primarily from the configuration of the recovery partition, where older Windows 10 installations typically have inadequate space allocated for security updates. These smaller partitions can hinder the successful application of critical patches\u2014like those in the cumulative update for Windows 11\u2014which require at least 250MB of free space. Users are encouraged to ensure that the recovery partition is adequately sized to allow for at least a 1 GB buffer, enabling smoother patch management and greater device security.",
