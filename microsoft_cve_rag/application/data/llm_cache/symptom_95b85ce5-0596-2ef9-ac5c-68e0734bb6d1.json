  "description": "Following the installation of Microsoft Edge version 126.0.2592.113, users may experience intermittent crashes during web browsing sessions. This observable behavior takes place particularly after the system has applied the security update related to CVE-2024-6772, which aimed to resolve inappropriate implementations within the V8 engine of Chrome. End users may notice that the browser closes unexpectedly or freezes, necessitating a restart of the application. In severe cases, the entire browser session might become unresponsive, leading to potential data loss for users who are actively working on web-based applications. System administrators should monitor user feedback and logs for patterns indicating these issues to facilitate prompt remedial actions.",
