  "description": "In Windows 11 build 23H2, users may experience significant taskbar functionality issues, particularly a glitchy performance resulting from a preview update. This symptom can manifest as unresponsive icons, difficulty in accessing pinned applications, and erratic taskbar behavior. Affected users may find it challenging to navigate the system efficiently, impacting overall productivity. The issues introduced in this update are addressed by KB5039212, which specifically aims to mitigate the negative effects on taskbar stability.
