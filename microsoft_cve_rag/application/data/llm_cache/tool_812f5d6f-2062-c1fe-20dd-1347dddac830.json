  "description": "**Tool Overview**:\n\nThis tool relates to the improvements made in the version 2.3.6.0 of the Entra Identity product, which enhances the auto-upgrade detection process.\n\n**Details**:\n\nThe enhancement ensures that auto-upgrade will no longer retry if it detects that the machine does not meet the required Operating System or .NET runtime requirements. This is crucial for maintaining system integrity and reducing unnecessary upgrade attempts in incompatible environments.\n\nTo implement this, users need to update to version 2.3.6.0 or higher. It automates the upgrade process by intelligently assessing hardware and software prerequisites before initiating upgrades.\n\nFor further details, visit the official documentation link: [Microsoft Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/hybrid/connect/reference-connect-version-history#2360).\n",
