  "description": "Affected systems show the potential for remote execution of malicious code via performance monitoring tools. This observable behavior can lead to unintentional execution of untrusted commands on the system, particularly when tools like performance monitor are actively collecting performance data. Users may notice degraded system stability, severe performance impacts, or unexpected application behavior. Build numbers for affected systems include 10.0.19045.4651 and 10.0.22621.3880, among others. Refer to KB articles KB-5040427 and KB-5040442 for further guidance on mitigation strategies.",
