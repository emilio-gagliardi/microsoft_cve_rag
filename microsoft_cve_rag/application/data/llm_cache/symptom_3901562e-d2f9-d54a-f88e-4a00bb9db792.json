  "description": "Exploitation of the vulnerability in the Microsoft Windows codecs library can result in information disclosure, specifically allowing access to kernel memory content. Users may notice unexpected disclosure of sensitive information, potentially affecting system security and integrity. Specifically, this occurs without user interaction, which means that any unauthorized access can happen at any time without the knowledge of the user. This issue is critical for systems running Windows versions such as 10 (including builds 22631, 22621, 19045, 19044, and 22000) and relevant server editions, as indicated by the associated KB Articles (KB5040442, KB5040431, and KB5040427). The incident reinforces the importance of timely patch management to mitigate this risk effectively.",
