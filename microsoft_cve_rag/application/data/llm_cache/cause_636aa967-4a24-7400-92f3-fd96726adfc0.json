  "description": "The underlying cause of the reported risks is due to 'vulnerability chaining' involving CVE-2024-21302 and CVE-2024-38202. This is a scenario where an attacker can exploit multiple vulnerabilities together, which decreases the attack complexity and broadens the overall impact. Both vulnerabilities necessitate that the attacker already has access to the target system, which could lead to severe consequences such as the ability to revert or replace critical Windows system files, potentially causing system-wide regressions. Additionally, these exploits can circumvent some virtualization-based security (VBS) features, thus increasing the threat to system integrity. As Microsoft continues to develop mitigations for these vulnerabilities, it is crucial for system administrators to stay updated through the security update guide notifications and follow the provided mitigation guidance to safeguard their environments.",
