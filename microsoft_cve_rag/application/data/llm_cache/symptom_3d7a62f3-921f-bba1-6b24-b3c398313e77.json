  "description": "After installing the March 2024 security update KB-5035853 on Windows 11 version 23H2, over 100 machines experienced notable performance issues characterized by slowness. Users reported that these slowdowns impacted system responsiveness significantly, prompting an investigation into the cause. Despite suggestions to address this issue with core isolation adjustments, many found that this did not alleviate the performance degradation. Instead, remediation steps included running multiple 'sfc /scannow' commands and performing inplace upgrades to restore system functionality. The latter solution reportedly resolved the slowness on the affected devices without resorting to core isolation settings, which failed to provide any performance improvements.",
