  "description": "An out-of-bounds read flaw in the Windows layer-2 bridge network driver, which can be exploited to induce a denial of service. This issue arises at the protocol level, requiring the attacker to be on a logically or physically adjacent network segment. Exploitation does not demand authenticated access or user interaction, leading to total loss of availability of affected components.",
