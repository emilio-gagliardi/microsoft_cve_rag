  "description": "Malicious logo images can exploit critical vulnerabilities within the image parsers used in UEFI boot processes of both Windows and Linux devices. These vulnerabilities exist across UEFI implementations from major Independent BIOS Vendors (IBVs), indicating a widespread issue that potentially affects a vast array of hardware systems. The exploitation occurs when an attacker replaces the boot image on a device, thus initiating a compromised boot sequence. Approximately a dozen critical vulnerabilities have been identified, which not only expose the systems to unauthorized access but also potentially lead to further exploits within the device's operating environment. System administrators should prioritize addressing these vulnerabilities to mitigate risks associated with UEFI booting environments, especially in enterprise deployments where security is paramount.",
