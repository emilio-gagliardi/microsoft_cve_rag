  "description": "Running Active Directory synchronization (AD Sync) on a Domain Controller (DC) is identified as a poor practice from a security perspective. This configuration can create potential security risks, particularly because it exposes the DC to unnecessary vulnerabilities. It is recommended to install AD Sync on a non-DC server, ideally on a dedicated system to mitigate these risks. Furthermore, it is crucial to ensure compatibility as AD Sync only supports Windows Server 2019, which limits options for server deployment. Adopting better practices in server configuration aids in maintaining a secure infrastructure.",
