  "description": "The main cause of the issue outlined in this post is the failure to execute the printer correction tool with the appropriate system privileges. When the tool is run by enterprise administrators, it must be executed as the local system account to correct printers for all users and sessions effectively. If the tool is not run with these elevated permissions, it may not have the necessary access to make the required changes. In contrast, individual users attempting to manage their printers need to run the tool using administrative credentials. This misalignment of user permissions can result in failures or limitations when trying to resolve printer issues across the system.",
