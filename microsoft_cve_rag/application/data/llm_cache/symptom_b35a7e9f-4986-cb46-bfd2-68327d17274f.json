  "description": "After the installation of the security updates related to CVE-2024-38062, users may experience unauthorized access levels, leading to unintended elevation of privileges on affected systems. This can manifest as users being able to access or modify settings and files that should be restricted, potentially exposing sensitive data or system configurations. The affected products include Windows 11 Version 23H2 (Build 10.0.22631.3880), Windows 10 (Builds 10.0.19045.4651, 10.0.19044.4651), and others noted in the related KB articles (KB5040442, KB5040431, KB5040427). System administrators should monitor for changes in access patterns or unexpected administrative capabilities that users may gain post-update, as this behavior could indicate the successful exploitation of the vulnerability despite applying the security fixes. As a result, vigilance is required to ensure that systems retain appropriate security posture after updates.",
