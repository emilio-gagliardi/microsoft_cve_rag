  "description": "The underlying cause of the issues stemming from PrintNightmare and its variants arises primarily from misconfigurations associated with group policies. Although Microsoft has theoretically addressed the vulnerabilities, organizations continue to suffer from these problems due to the ambiguity and complexity of the group policy settings related to printing services. These configuration issues often lead to improper handling of print server roles and user permissions, resulting in exploitable scenarios. Without clear guidance and proper remediation, administrators may inadvertently leave vulnerable configurations intact, perpetuating security risks. This situation highlights the critical need for detailed documentation and thorough understanding of group policy interactions with print functions in enterprise environments.",
