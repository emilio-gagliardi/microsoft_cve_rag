  "description": "**Fix Overview**:\n\nTo address potential issues arising from BitLocker in conjunction with UEFI firmware updates, consider updating the firmware for the OEM devices.\n\n1. Verify if your device's firmware is up-to-date by checking the manufacturer's website for any available updates related to UEFI or Intel Management Engine (ME).\n2. Apply any relevant firmware updates to ensure compatibility with BitLocker, particularly for systems where BitLocker was non-paused during the update.\n3. After updating the firmware, test the system to confirm that it is bootable and BitLocker functions correctly.\n\n**Details**:\n- It's critical that users do not pause BitLocker during these updates to maintain data integrity.\n- Backup any sensitive data prior to performing firmware updates to prevent potential data loss as a precaution.
