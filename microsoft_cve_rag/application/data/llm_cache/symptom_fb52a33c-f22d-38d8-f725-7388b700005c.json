  "description": "Users may observe that the Microsoft Edge browser, based on Chromium version 128.0.2739.42, is vulnerable to privilege escalation issues due to insufficient data validation in the installer. This can manifest as unexpected behavior during installation processes, where malicious local attackers could potentially exploit this flaw through crafted symbolic links. While using the browser, end users may notice increased risk if they have not updated to the secure version. It is imperative for system administrators to ensure that affected systems are updated to the latest version to prevent possible privilege escalations. The issue is documented under KB-128.0.2739.42, guiding users to implement the recommended security updates promptly.",
