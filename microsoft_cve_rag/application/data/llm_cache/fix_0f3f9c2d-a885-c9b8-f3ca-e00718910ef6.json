  "description": "To mitigate the issue described in CVE-2023-4863, it is essential to update Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) to version 116.0.1938.81 or later. Users should also ensure they are running the WebP image extension version 1.0.62681.0 or later. The recommended update addresses a heap buffer overflow vulnerability in the WebP image format, and Microsoft advises users to apply updates available through the Microsoft Store, which will automatically provide the latest versions. For any disconnected environments, organizations can manually distribute updates via the Microsoft Store for Business or Education. Verification of the installed update can be performed by using PowerShell to check the app package version: Get-AppxPackage -Name microsoft.webpimageextension.",
