  "description": "**Tool Overview**:\n\nIvanti\u2019s Security Controls is a solution designed to enhance the security posture of systems by providing security controls specifically tailored for managing updates and vulnerabilities. \n\n**Details**:\n\nThis tool can be used to apply out-of-band (OOB) updates that address critical issues in systems infrastructure, particularly Domain Controllers (DC). In this context, the tool leverages the Microsoft guidance to install updates selectively on DCs only, ensuring that the most critical security enhancements are applied without disrupting other operations. It integrates with patch management workflows to streamline the application of such updates, facilitating compliance while minimizing risks. \n\nUsers should ensure that their Ivanti configurations are set to recognize and implement the latest updates as recommended by Microsoft, reinforcing this tool's effectiveness in managing security controls for OOB updates.",
