  "description": "After the installation of security updates KB-5040442, KB-5040431, and KB-5040427, users may experience unexpected behavior due to an elevation of privilege issue in the Windows graphics component. This could manifest as applications exhibiting permissions they shouldn't have, which could lead to unauthorized access to system resources. For instance, end users may find that they can perform administrative actions through a non-admin account, potentially compromising system integrity. Additionally, certain applications might crash or behave unpredictably when rendering graphics due to underlying graphics processing changes related to the patching. Such behaviors may lead to decreased productivity and increased frustration among users relying on these applications.",
