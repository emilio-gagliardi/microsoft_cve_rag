  "description": "Users on affected Windows systems, particularly those running Windows 10 and Windows 11, may experience unauthorized elevation of privileges when interacting with the desktop window manager (DWM). This observable behavior allows potential attackers to gain system-level access under certain conditions, particularly after applying specific security updates related to KB5037788, KB5037771, and others referenced. Systems running builds like 10.0.19045.4412 and 10.0.22631.3593 may exhibit this symptom, leading to significant security concerns within an enterprise environment. Monitoring user interactions and DWM behaviors post-update is crucial to mitigate risks associated with this vulnerability. System administrators should remain vigilant for unexpected changes in user privileges post-update.",
