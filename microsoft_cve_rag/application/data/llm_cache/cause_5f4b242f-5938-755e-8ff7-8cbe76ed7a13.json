  "description": "The underlying cause of the issue stems from critical vulnerabilities in VMware sandbox and hypervisor protections across several products, including VMware ESXi, Workstation, Fusion, and Cloud Foundation. This situation is particularly alarming as these bugs allow unauthorized access by hackers to 'break out' of the secure sandbox environment, which should ideally contain applications within isolated environments. These vulnerabilities affect all versions of the mentioned products, extending to those that are past their end-of-life support, meaning that even obsolete versions remain susceptible to exploitation. VMware has released patches to address these vulnerabilities urgently, emphasizing the critical nature of the situation due to the potential for significant security breaches. This context underscores the importance of patch management for all VMware users to mitigate the identified risks and secure their systems against exploitation.",
