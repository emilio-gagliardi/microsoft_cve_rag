  "description": "The issue is caused by improper link resolution prior to file access, leading to potential elevation of privilege on Windows systems. Specifically, this arises from the Windows Common Log File System driver allowing attackers to exploit improper handling of symbolic links, allowing access to files and directories that should be restricted. This vulnerability impacts multiple versions of Windows 10 and 11, evidenced by build numbers including 10.0.26100.2033, 10.0.22631.4317, and others. The KB Articles associated provide further details on the updates addressing this flaw.",
