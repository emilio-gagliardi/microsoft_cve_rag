  "description": "The exploitation of a vulnerability in the Windows Bluetooth driver can lead to the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, particularly certain kernel memory content. This issue is inherent in Windows 11, version 24H2, impacting users who may inadvertently expose system memory to local or remote attackers. Such an incident could result in attackers gaining access to confidential data, creating a significant security risk for users. The vulnerability, documented under KB5041571, emphasizes the importance of applying the security update promptly to mitigate these potential information disclosure risks. Without the update, system administrators should remain vigilant for any signs of unauthorized access or unexpected system behavior as a consequence of this security flaw.",
