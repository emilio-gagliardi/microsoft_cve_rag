  "description": "Users of Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) version 130.0.2849.46 may notice unexpected behavior where certain web content appears to be spoofed or deceptive, potentially leading to confusion or concern about the authenticity of information displayed. This spoofing issue primarily affects the user's ability to trust the visual indicators that signify legitimate web addresses and content, with users possibly encountering warnings that do not align with their expectations. Additionally, the system may allow unauthorized access to some restricted information, as the spoofing could diminish perceived confidentiality and potentially mislead users when navigating the web. This vulnerability requires user interaction, often necessitating that the user be lured into opening a malicious site directly. The update addressing this scenario is documented in KB-130.0.2849.46, with implications for user awareness efforts during browsing sessions.",
