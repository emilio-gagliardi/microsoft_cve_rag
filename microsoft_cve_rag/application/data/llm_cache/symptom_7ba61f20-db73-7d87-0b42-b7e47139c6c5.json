  "description": "Systems utilizing the Windows Layer-2 Bridge network driver may experience a total loss of availability characterized by service interruptions or complete unresponsiveness. Users might find that network connections fail to establish or existing connections are abruptly terminated. This is particularly noticeable during high network activity or after specific updates, which may leave them unable to access necessary resources. The impacted products include various Windows 10, Windows 11, and Windows Server versions, specifically those listed under KB Articles such as KB5041592 and KB5041571. The issue arises due to a null pointer dereference leading to a denial of service, causing significant disruptions across the network.",
