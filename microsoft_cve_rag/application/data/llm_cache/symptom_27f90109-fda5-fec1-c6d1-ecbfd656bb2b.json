  "description": "When executing RoboCopy with the /DST switch, users may encounter unexpected behaviors that hinder effective job monitoring and file copying, particularly during Daylight Saving Time changes. This can lead to issues such as timestamps being incorrectly adjusted or jobs being queued improperly. The problem appears to stem from how RoboCopy interprets the /DST argument, as indicated by practical tests resolving the issue through proper use of this switch. The symptoms may significantly impact automated backup solutions that rely on precise timing and logging features offered by GUI-based interfaces. Ongoing usage of RoboCopy for critical data transfers requires awareness of these quirks to ensure operational integrity.",
