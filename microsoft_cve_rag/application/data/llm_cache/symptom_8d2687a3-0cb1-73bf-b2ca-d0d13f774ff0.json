  "symptom_label": "windows_update_fails_due_to_obsolete_version",
  "description": "The system is running an obsolete build version (1511, released in 2015) of Windows 10, which prevents it from receiving newer feature updates. Users should upgrade to the latest build, specifically 22H2, to ensure they can install essential updates and maintain system functionality. Failure to upgrade from such an outdated version can lead to difficulties in accessing the latest features and security improvements. Diagnosis of the issue can be triggered by noticing the absence of available updates within the Windows Update section. System administrators are advised to recommend using the Windows Update Assistant or directly upgrading via Microsoft's official website for seamless installation.",
