  "description": "Upon application of the security update related to CVE-2024-43584, users may experience issues with the Windows Scripting Engine's Anti-Malware Scanning Interface. Specifically, the scanning functionality may not engage when running scripts via cscript or wscript, resulting in a potential security feature bypass. This could manifest as a failure to block malicious scripts or unauthorized access to system resources during script execution. The affected builds include Windows 11 Version 24H2 (10.0.26100.2033) documented in KB5044284, and prior builds such as Windows 11 Version 23H2 (10.0.22631.4317, KB5044285), 22H2 (10.0.22621.4317, KB5044285), and 21H2 (10.0.22000.3260, KB5044280). This issue emphasizes the critical need for diligent monitoring of script execution as it could lead to malicious activities if not addressed promptly.",
