  "description": "When managing devices through Microsoft Intune, administrators may find that the ownership of devices needs to be updated either via the Intune console or Microsoft Graph. This can lead to issues in device compliance and management if the owner is not updated correctly. Failure to change the owner might restrict access to certain features and functions within Intune, impacting device oversight. In environments with numerous devices, the need for accurate ownership details becomes crucial to streamline management processes. Regularly ensuring that ownership is correct mitigates potential administrative challenges and enhances overall device management efficacy.",
