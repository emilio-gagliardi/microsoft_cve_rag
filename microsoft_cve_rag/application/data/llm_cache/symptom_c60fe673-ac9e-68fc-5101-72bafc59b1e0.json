  "symptom_label": "WindowsLapsDeploymentBlockedDueToGpoFormatting",
  "description": "The issue involves an incorrect formatting specification in the Group Policy Object (GPO) ADMX files, which are designed to facilitate Windows Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) deployment. This misconfiguration prevents the successful deployment of Windows LAPS, as the expected formatting for the security identifier (SID) or domain/user/group is inaccurately documented. As a result, administrators may encounter significant obstacles in securing local administrator accounts on managed devices, impacting overall system security and compliance efforts.",
