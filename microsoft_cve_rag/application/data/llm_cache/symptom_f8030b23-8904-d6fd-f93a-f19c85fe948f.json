  "description": "In Microsoft environments utilizing anti-spam features, if the outbound policy is misconfigured, suspicious outbound emails may not be correctly filtered. Specifically, the default setting allows for suspicious messages to be sent without restriction if the 'send a copy of suspicious outbound...' setting is enabled. This situation could lead to potential data leakage or misrepresentation of the organization, necessitating immediate configuration adjustments to enforce stricter outbound email monitoring.",
