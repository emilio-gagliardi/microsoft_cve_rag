  "description": "Users may experience intermittent crashes in Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) version 130.0.2849.46 following the use of web pages that contain crafted HTML, due to a use after free condition. This observable behavior can lead to unexpected terminations of the browser during normal operations, affecting user productivity significantly. Administrators should be aware that these crashes are linked to the underlying Chromium update that resolves a heap corruption vulnerability addressed in CVE-2024-9960. The crashes manifest when users navigate to specific content designed to exploit the free memory access flaw before the update was applied. The fix is included in the latest security update released on October 17, 2024, which upgrades Edge to version 130.0.6723.59.",
