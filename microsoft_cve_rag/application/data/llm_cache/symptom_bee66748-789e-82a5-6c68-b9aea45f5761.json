  "description": "Users may experience situations where downloaded files that should be flagged by the Windows Mark of the Web (MOTW) feature do not show the expected protections. This can occur after an attacker successfully crafts a malicious file that evades the MOTW defenses, leading to potential exposure of users to unsafe documents. As a result, security features such as the protected view in Microsoft Office, which rely on proper MOTW tagging, may not activate, potentially allowing harmful content to be executed. This observable behavior can frustrate end users, who might not realize they are exposing themselves to risks when opening files downloaded from the internet. This issue impacts several Windows 10 and 11 builds, specifically those detailed in KB5037788, KB5037771, KB5037770, and KB5037768.",
