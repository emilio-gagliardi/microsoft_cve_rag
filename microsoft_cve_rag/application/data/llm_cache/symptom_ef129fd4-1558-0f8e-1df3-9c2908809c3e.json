  "description": "Users may experience a failure in network connection when attempting to connect to a SQL Server database using Microsoft SQL Client applications. This issue arises due to a vulnerability in the Microsoft WDAC OLE DB provider related to remote code execution, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution in the user's SQL client context. Failure to establish connections can interrupt workflows, result in application crashes, and degrade overall user productivity. This symptom has been observed across multiple Windows builds, including 10.0.19045.4046, 10.0.22631.3155, and 10.0.22000.2777, as documented in KB5034763. System administrators should be vigilant for reports from end users about these connectivity issues following the installation of the latest monthly rollup updates.",
