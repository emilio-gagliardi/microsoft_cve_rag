  "description": "There exists a potential for remote code execution in systems utilizing the Microsoft Speech Application Programming Interface (SAPI) due to a use-after-free vulnerability. Users may experience unexpected behaviors or security prompts during the execution of applications that interact with SAPI, particularly after clicking on malicious links. Certain builds, including Windows 11 Version 24H2 (10.0.26100.2033), Windows 10 Version 22H2 (10.0.19045.5011), and several others spanning multiple Windows versions, may be impacted. The issue could result in unauthorized access to sensitive information or disruptions in application performance. Users should refer to the corresponding KB Articles (KB5044284, KB5044285, KB5044273) for more detailed remediation steps.",
