  "description": "After updating Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) to version 129.0.2792.52, users are experiencing frequent application crashes when accessing specific webpages that rely on advanced JavaScript functionalities. This observable behavior may be particularly evident on sites utilizing complex graphics or interactive content. The issue appears to be linked to instability introduced with the update related to recent vulnerabilities, resulting in frustrating usability experiences. Consequently, system administrators are likely receiving reports of unexpected closures and loss of session data from end users who are trying to engage with these web resources. Keeping the browser updated is crucial, and users should frequently check for the latest versions to maintain system integrity.",
