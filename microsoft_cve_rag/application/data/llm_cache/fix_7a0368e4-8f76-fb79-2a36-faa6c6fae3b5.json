  "description": "**Fix Overview**:\n\nTo resolve performance issues experienced by users of the Outlook client, the following actions are recommended:\n\n1. **Restart the Outlook client or app** - This will help apply the necessary changes to address the performance issues. Note that Outlook desktop client users may need to perform this action twice due to caching issues.\n\n2. **For Outlook on the web users** - Refresh your session to see if the performance improves. If not, clear your browser's cache and refresh the Outlook on the web session.\n\n**Details**:\n- These steps are recommended to mitigate the identified performance problems that manifest as increased resource usage and client instability.\n- Continuous telemetry and testing have shown that these solutions are effective. \n",
