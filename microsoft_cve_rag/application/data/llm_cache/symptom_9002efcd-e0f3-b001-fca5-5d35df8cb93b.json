  "description": "After installing updates from KB5032190, KB5032192, KB5032199, and KB5032189, systems may exhibit behaviors indicative of elevation of privilege vulnerabilities. This could potentially enable unauthorized users to gain enhanced access rights, impacting resource confidentiality and integrity. Affected build numbers include Windows 10 (10.0.22621.2715, 10.0.19045.3693); users may notice unauthorized modifications to files or settings usually reserved for privileged accounts, thus increasing the risk of data breaches or unauthorized operations on systems.",
