  "description": "End users may notice unauthorized access or changes to their system as a consequence of potential elevation of privilege through the Windows Kernel. This issue affects several builds including Windows 10 version 22H2 (10.0.19045.4412) and Windows 11 version 23H2 (10.0.22631.3593). Users may observe unexpected behavior such as changes to system settings or files without their consent, as well as performance slowdowns or system instability. It is crucial for system administrators to remain vigilant and monitor user reports of unusual activities on these affected versions, as this could indicate exploitation of the vulnerability.
