  "description": "After applying the security update associated with KB-126.0.2592.8, users of Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) version 126.0.2592.8 may experience unexpected crashes of the browser. These crashes manifest as abrupt terminations while browsing, leading to potential data loss, particularly if users are in the midst of filling out forms or processing transactions. Users may notice the browser becoming unresponsive before crashing, resulting in an interruption of their web activity. Additionally, the issues may affect users' ability to open previously visited tabs, thus impacting workflow and user experience negatively. This behavior can be attributed to the underlying changes made to address CVE-2024-6290, which relates to a flaw in the Chromium engine, highlighting the importance of users staying updated with the latest version to mitigate these disruptions.",
