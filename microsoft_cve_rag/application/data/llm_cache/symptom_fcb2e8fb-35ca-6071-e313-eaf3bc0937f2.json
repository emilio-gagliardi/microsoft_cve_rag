  "description": "After the installation of the provided security updates for Windows components, users may experience complete denial of service. This situation can occur particularly with Windows 11 (Versions 21H2, 22H2, 23H2, and 24H2) and Windows Server 2022, indicating a loss of availability. End users could notice symptoms such as an inability to access network resources, which can hinder operations related to communications and services dependent on the secure channel. This denial of service can happen due to a vulnerability allowing attackers to exploit network conditions, potentially resulting in persistent unavailability of access even after attempts to restore services. For reference, the relevant KB Articles associated with these updates are KB5041592, KB5041585, and KB5041571.",
