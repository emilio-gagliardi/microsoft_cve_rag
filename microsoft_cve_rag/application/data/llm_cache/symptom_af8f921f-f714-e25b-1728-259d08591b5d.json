  "description": "Following the implementation of the security update related to CVE-2024-38041, users on affected Windows builds may experience unauthorized exposure of sensitive information, leading to potential leaks of kernel memory. This can manifest as unexpected behaviors in applications that rely on this memory, potentially resulting in degraded performance or instability. Additionally, users may notice discrepancies in application behavior, as some kernel-level information that should remain confidential is disclosed to unauthorized actors. This could affect a variety of Windows 10 and 11 systems, particularly those running on builds 10.0.22631.3880, 10.0.22621.3880, 10.0.19045.4651, and others, which have corresponding KB articles including KB5040442, KB5040431, and KB5040427, indicating known issues following the update. System administrators should monitor for signs of information disclosure during runtime to ensure endpoints remain secure.",
