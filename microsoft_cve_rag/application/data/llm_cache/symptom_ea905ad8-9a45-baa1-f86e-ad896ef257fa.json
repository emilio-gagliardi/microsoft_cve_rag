  "description": "The Windows Message Queuing Client (MSMQC) may inadvertently expose sensitive information due to known flaws. Users may notice unauthorized access to contained data, specifically small portions of heap memory. This situation brings about concerns related to data integrity and confidentiality, as attacker access could result in the disclosure of restricted information. Organizations operating on affected builds, such as Windows 10 versions 10.0.19044.3930, 10.0.19045.3930, and various Windows Server iterations (Windows Server 2012, 2016), could experience heightened security risks. Users are advised to apply the respective patches listed under KB-5034134, KB-5034123, KB-5034122, and KB-5034121 promptly to mitigate exposure.",
