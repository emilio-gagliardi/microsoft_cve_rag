  "description": "Some users are experiencing performance issues with the Outlook client, resulting in high memory utilization. This resource spike leads to unresponsive behavior, causing the application to freeze or even crash. The issue appears to impact a subset of users who access services through affected infrastructure within the Microsoft 365 suite, particularly Exchange Online. The current analysis is actively investigating user feedback and telemetry data to isolate the root cause. A mitigation plan is underway in response to these resource management challenges.",
