  "description": "In the context of Microsoft Edge version 126.0.2592.56, users may observe that certain user interface elements seem to be altered or falsified. This spoofing behavior could mislead users into interacting with deceptive content, potentially affecting their trust in the application. The issue arises when users inadvertently click on specially crafted URLs, leading to visual representations that do not accurately reflect the underlying elements. Although the integrity of data may not be directly compromised, the altered UI can obscure important information, prompting an urgent need for users and administrators to apply the security update identified in KB38083 to mitigate this risk.",
