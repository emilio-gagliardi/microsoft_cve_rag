  "description": "The underlying cause of CVE-2023-35641 is a flaw in the Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) service that allows it to be exploited via remote code execution. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted DHCP message to a ICS-enabled server, which can be located within the same network segment as the attacker. This attack is restricted to local network topologies, requiring that the attacker shares a network segment, such as a local subnet. It potentially results in high impacts across confidentiality, integrity, and availability, affecting various Windows products including builds 10.0.25398.584, 10.0.22000.2652, 10.0.19045.3803, and associated with KB articles such as KB-5033379 and KB-5033375.",
