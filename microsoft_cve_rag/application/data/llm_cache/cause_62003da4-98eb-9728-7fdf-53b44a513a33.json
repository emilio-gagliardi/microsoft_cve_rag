  "description": "The underlying cause of CVE-2023-35630 is a vulnerability within the Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) feature that allows remote code execution. This issue arises from the ability for an attacker to modify the length field in a DHCPv6 message during an information request phase. Given that the affected component is bound to the network stack, exploitation is limited to a logically adjacent topology, which means the attacker must be on the same shared physical or logical network segment, such as a local subnet. The vulnerability impacts several Windows Server builds including 10.0.14393.6529, 10.0.19045.3803, 10.0.22000.2652, and more. Users should refer to KB articles KB-5033379, KB-5033375, KB-5033372, and KB-5033369 for mitigation steps and patches provided by Microsoft.",
