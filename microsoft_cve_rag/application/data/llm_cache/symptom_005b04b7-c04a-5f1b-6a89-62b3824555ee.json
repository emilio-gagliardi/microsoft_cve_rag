  "description": "The HTTP/2 Rapid Reset Attack (CVE-2023-44487) can cause web server performance issues in affected environments, particularly impacting Windows Server 2022, 2019, and 2016. When exploited, this vulnerability results in an excessive number of reset streams per minute, which can lead to connections being prematurely closed and degraded service availability. The recommended mitigation involves installing the latest Windows updates, specifically KB-5031364 for Server 2022, and KB-5031361 for Server 2019 and Server 2016, alongside configuring the new registry keys to limit the number of resets allowed per connection.",
