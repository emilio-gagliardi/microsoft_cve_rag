  "description": "After applying updates corresponding to KB-5036925, KB-5036910, KB-5036899, KB-5036896, KB-5036894, KB-5036893, and KB-5036892, users may experience a failure during remote code execution operations related to the windows rndismp6.sys driver. This issue primarily affects users on various builds of Windows 10, including builds 19045.4291, 19044.4291, 22631.3447, 22000.2899, 22621.3447, and 10240.20596. The failure manifests as an inability to execute remote commands or interactions that rely on this driver, potentially disrupting workflows that depend on stable and secure remote access. The observable behavior could range from processes timing out to explicit error messages indicating that the execution was halted unexpectedly. As system administrators deploy these updates, they should be aware of this issue and monitor user reports regarding remote functionalities.",
