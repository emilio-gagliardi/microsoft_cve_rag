  "description": "Users experience complete denial of service with the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) on affected systems. This impact is observed when attempting to access resources managed by the directory service, where requests are unable to be fulfilled, leading to significant disruption in user authentication and directory queries. This issue affects multiple Windows versions, including Windows 10 (various builds), and impacts both server and client installations noted in KB-5034763. The service becomes completely unavailable, either during the attack or persisting after, directly hindering operations dependent on LDAP functionality.",
