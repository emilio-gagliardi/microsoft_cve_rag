  "description": "The underlying cause of the issue appears to be related to UEFI firmware compatibility, particularly affecting users with older BIOS versions in conjunction with Windows virtualization-based security (VBS) and core isolation features. Users have reported problems that persist even after reinstalling the operating system, indicating that the OS may not be the root of the issue. A specific resolution was identified through the installation of a UEFI update released in February 2024, which suggests that prior firmware versions may lack necessary support for certain VBS functionality. This situation highlights the importance of keeping UEFI firmware updated to ensure compatibility with advanced security features like core isolation in Windows. Problems associated with build numbers and UEFI could lead to significant security or stability concerns for users relying on these technologies.",
