  "description": "After applying security updates KB5035859, KB5035857, KB5035856, KB5035854, and KB5035853 on various Windows 10 and Windows 11 versions, users may experience unexpected escalations in privileges, causing unauthorized access to restricted system functions. This can result in administrative actions being performed by standard user accounts, leading to potential security breaches. Systems affected include Windows 10 version 22H2 and 21H2, along with Windows 11 versions 23H2 and 22H2, with specific build numbers including 10.0.25398.763 and 10.0.22631.3296. The observable behavior may include unauthorized changes to system settings and unauthorized executions of applications normally restricted to high privilege accounts, thereby undermining system integrity and user trust.",
