  "description": "The system may experience total loss of availability when a denial of service attack is executed against Windows Network Address Translation (NAT) functionality. This symptom manifests as the inability to access network resources, which can disrupt connectivity for users and server applications alike. End users may notice that they cannot establish or maintain network connections, resulting in operational downtime. Additionally, this loss of availability can be persistent, meaning it might continue even after the attack has ceased. This issue affects various builds of Windows 11 (including version 24H2 and 23H2) and Windows 10 along with Windows Server editions as outlined in the respective KB Articles (KB5041571, KB5041585, KB5041782, KB5041592). System administrators should monitor network connectivity and user complaints as indicators of this symptomatic behavior.",
