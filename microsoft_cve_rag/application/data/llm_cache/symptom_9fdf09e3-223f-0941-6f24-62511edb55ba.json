  "description": "Users may experience a risk of arbitrary code execution on their systems if they connect to malicious servers as a result of the vulnerability associated with Windows Telephony Service. This occurs specifically on Windows 11 versions 24H2, 23H2, 22H2, and various Windows 10 builds as indicated in KB5046617, KB5046633, and KB5046613. The behavior manifests when users are tricked into sending requests to these malicious entities, which could lead to the execution of harmful code on their devices. Consequently, there is a significant concern for loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of impacted systems, making vigilant endpoint management and patching essential for mitigation.",
