  "description": "The cause of the issue seems to stem from potential failure of the drive as indicated by the failure to report necessary SMART data. If SMART is disabled or incompatible with the drive, this may lead to undetected drive failures. Regular running of chkdsk might be masking underlying hardware problems, which require more in-depth checks using tools like SmartMonTools. Additionally, misconfigurations during the execution of DISM commands can be exacerbated when a corrupted or incomplete Windows 10 ISO is used as a source, leading to issues in system repair processes. Therefore, ensuring proper configurations and utilizing validated sources is crucial.",
