  "description": "To mitigate the impact of a recent WebKit update affecting the enterprise SSO plug-in for Microsoft 365 services, administrators are advised to evaluate delaying updates to iOS, iPadOS, and macOS versions 17.1.x and 14.1.x. This regression has resulted in SSO failures when signing into applications and resources, particularly those utilizing browser SSO. Utilizing Intune as a management solution, admins can prevent operating system version updates on managed devices to control when these updates are applied. It's crucial to assess organizational policies on security and the importance of using the SSO extension before proceeding with any upgrades. Alternative authentication methods should also be considered during this window until a resolution is provided by Apple.",
