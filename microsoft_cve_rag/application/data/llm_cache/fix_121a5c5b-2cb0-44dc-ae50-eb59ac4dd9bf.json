  "description": "**Fix Overview**:\n\nTo troubleshoot and potentially resolve HTTP 404 errors during Outlook authentication:\n\n1. Check the user's sign-in logs for any relevant prompts or messages, such as \u201cmanage this device or just this app.\u201d\n\n2. Inspect conditional access policies, which may be preventing users from completing their authentication steps.\n\n3. Review unattended logs for additional insights into authentication failures that may not appear in the standard logs.\n\n4. If SSL decryption or MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) is being used, temporarily exempt the source IP from these processes to determine if they are causing the 404 error instead of being a side effect of the underlying issue.\n\n**Details**:\n- Observations indicate that Outlook authentication on Windows Server 2019 may route through unintended regions (e.g., UK instead of the US), which could complicate authentication.\n- Understanding whether the issue stems from conditional access or SSL settings is essential for effective troubleshooting. \n",
