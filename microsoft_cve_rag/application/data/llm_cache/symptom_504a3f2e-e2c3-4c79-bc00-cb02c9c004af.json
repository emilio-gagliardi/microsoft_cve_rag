  "description": "After applying a configuration manager update to Microsoft Configuration Manager version 2403 or 2309 hotfix release update, admins' co-managed devices are missing endpoint protection policies. This issue specifically impacts those devices managed by Microsoft Intune, while other devices and policies not administered in this manner remain unaffected. The problem is rooted in a component update of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint that inadvertently removes the endpoint protection policies, leading to a failure in device management functionality. A short-term mitigation is advised until a long-term fix is confirmed, with expected deployment spanning from May 13 to May 17, 2024. It's crucial for system administrators to remain vigilant for further updates and deploy interim solutions as outlined in the released notes.",
