  "description": "The observed behavior indicates that a manual installation of updates was necessary for the .NET framework on certain systems. This situation arose during the update process where SCCM (System Center Configuration Manager) faced issues when attempting to install the required .NET updates automatically. Following the manual intervention, SCCM was then able to successfully execute the installation of the necessary updates without further complications. This symptom could potentially impact systems running Windows Server 2016, particularly those associated with build numbers relevant to KB5036899. System administrators should note that this situation may lead to delays in patch deployment and overall system security if not addressed promptly.",
