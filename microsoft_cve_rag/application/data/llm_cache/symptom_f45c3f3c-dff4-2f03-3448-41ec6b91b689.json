  "description": "A significant information disclosure vulnerability has been identified in Microsoft Access that allows attackers to obtain a victim's NTLM hash. This occurs when a Microsoft Office document embedded with an Access database linked to a remote SQL Server database using Windows NT authentication is opened. As Access updates a table with this link, it inadvertently exposes the NTLM hash to the attacker, particularly over firewall-friendly ports such as 80 or 443. This vulnerability has not been addressed adequately by Microsoft despite its serious implications, leading to potential credential leakage.",
