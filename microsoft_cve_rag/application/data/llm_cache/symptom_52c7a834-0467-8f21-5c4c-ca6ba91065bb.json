  "description": "Users may experience instability within systems running affected builds of Windows, specifically with builds 10.0.19045.4291, 10.0.19044.4291, 10.0.22631.3447, 10.0.22000.2899, 10.0.22621.3447, and 10.0.10240.20596. This instability manifests through unexpected behavior such as system reboots, failed startup, or failure to load vital security features related to secure boot processes. The implications of these issues are particularly notable in environments that rely heavily on secure boot functionality to mitigate unauthorized code execution. System administrators are advised to refer to KB articles KB-5036925, KB-5036894, KB-5036893, and KB-5036892 for detailed guidance on addressing and patching vulnerabilities associated with this behavior. Appropriate action is essential to restore smooth operational capabilities for impacted users.",
