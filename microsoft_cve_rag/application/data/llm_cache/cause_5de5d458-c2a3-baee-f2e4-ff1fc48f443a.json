  "description": "The underlying cause of the black screen issue during login to Azure Virtual Desktop is attributed to the non-security preview update released on July 23, 2024, which was carried through subsequent updates but only addressed in the October 22, 2024 update. This problem manifests itself when users attempt to log in, resulting in an application error logged with Event ID 1000, caused by the faulty application 'svchost.exe_appxsvc'. The issue is particularly pertinent for enterprise environments utilizing Windows 10, version 22H2, wherein users may also experience registration problems leading to other symptoms such as unexpected closing of the Start menu. It is noteworthy that this issue does not commonly affect users of Windows 10 Education or Home editions due to the different usage context of Azure Virtual Desktop. Installations of updates released after October 22, 2024, effectively resolve this issue without requiring additional corrective measures.",
