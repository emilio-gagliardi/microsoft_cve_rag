  "description": "Users may experience degraded performance or intermittent system responsiveness issues when using the Windows Remote Access Connection Manager on affected build versions. Systems running Windows 10 builds 19045.4291, 19044.4291, 22631.3447, and others could exhibit slow network connectivity, leading to frustrating user experiences during remote sessions. The continuous memory leak caused by this information disclosure vulnerability could eventually lead to unexpected application crashes or hanging processes, significantly impacting workflow efficiency. These issues have been acknowledged in related KB articles KB-5037788, KB-5037771, and others, which offer guidance on mitigating the adverse effects of this development. System administrators should ensure their environments are updated to the latest patches to avoid these symptoms.",
