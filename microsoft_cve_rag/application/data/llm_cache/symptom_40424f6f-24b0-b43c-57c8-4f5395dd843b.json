  "description": "After applying the cumulative update (CU) intended for Windows Server 2016 systems, the systems may still be reported as vulnerable. This persistent vulnerability requires additional registry keys to be added following the installation of the CU to fully remediate the issue. The vulnerability in question is associated with CVE-2017-8563, which outlines that the CU alone does not resolve the issue, leading to continued vulnerability flags from security scanners. As detailed in KB-4034879, the absence of these required registry entries means that systems are still susceptible to potential exploits despite seeming to be updated. System administrators must verify that specific registry keys are present on affected servers to ensure compliance and mitigate risk effectively.",
