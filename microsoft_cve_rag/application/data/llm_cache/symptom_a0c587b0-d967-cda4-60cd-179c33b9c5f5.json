  "description": "End users may notice that their systems, specifically those running Windows builds 10.0.19045, 10.0.19044, 10.0.22631, 10.0.22000, 10.0.22621, and prior builds (e.g., 10.0.10240), are potentially vulnerable to bypassing the secure boot feature. This behavior could lead users to believe their systems are operating under secure conditions while, in fact, they are at risk of exploitation. The KB articles related to this issue include KB-5036925, KB-5036910, KB-5036909, KB-5036899, KB-5036896, KB-5036894, KB-5036893, and KB-5036892, which further detail the implications of this behavior. System administrators may need to verify that their systems have the latest updates applied to mitigate these risks effectively. Overall, this situation necessitates immediate attention to ensure the security and integrity of the systems in question.",
