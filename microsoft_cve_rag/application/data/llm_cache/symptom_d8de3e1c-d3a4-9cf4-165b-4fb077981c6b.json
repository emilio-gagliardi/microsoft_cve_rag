  "description": "After the installation of Microsoft Edge version 130.0.2849.46 on October 17, 2024, users may experience a notable security risk where successful exploitation requires users to click a specially crafted link. This can lead to remote code execution within the browser's renderer process, which can compromise the integrity of the session. Such an interaction is vital for the attack to succeed, as it does not exploit any underlying system components without user involvement. Consequently, users should observe warnings regarding clicking unfamiliar or suspicious links, as it is a critical part of preventing unauthorized access. Additionally, it is advisable to monitor browser behavior for unexpected prompts or requests following interaction with links.",
