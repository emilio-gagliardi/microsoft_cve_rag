  "description": "The automatic defrag functionality in Windows 10 version 1607 has been reported to cause significant wear on SSDs due to its failure to correctly detect the drives. This malfunction can lead to excessive write operations, resulting in premature exhaustion of SSD write capacity. In some cases, SSDs may be rendered unusable within only a few months, with a couple failing in just one week. System administrators managing fleets of SSD devices may experience substantial hardware losses if this issue is not addressed. Monitoring and adjusting defragmentation settings may be necessary to preserve SSD longevity and performance.",
