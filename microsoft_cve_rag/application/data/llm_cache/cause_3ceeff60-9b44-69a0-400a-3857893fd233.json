  "description": "The core cause of the issue lies in the registry key not being set or changed by the update related to KB-5020805. This lack of configuration allowed users to manually override the default settings. However, with the October 10 update, the system entered the 'full enforcement' phase, during which the previously set registry key is now ignored. This change has resulted in unintended behavior as the enforcement of the new settings does not respect user-defined configurations. The situation highlights a misalignment between update behavior and user expectations regarding manual registry modifications.",
