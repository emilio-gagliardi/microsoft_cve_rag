  "description": "Users may experience challenges detecting the installation status of Acrobat and Acrobat Reader due to their settings being stored in different registry keys. This can create ambiguity, especially when both programs are installed on a system. The detection involves locating 'acrobat.exe' and 'acrord32.exe' in their respective directories, which can be cumbersome and lead to inconsistencies in system management for administrators managing multiple Adobe applications.",
