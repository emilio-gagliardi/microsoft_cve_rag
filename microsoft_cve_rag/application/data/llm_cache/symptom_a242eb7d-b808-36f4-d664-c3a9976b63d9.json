  "description": "After applying the security update associated with KB5041571 for Windows 11 version 24H2, users may experience unauthorized elevation of privileges on their systems. This symptom manifests as unexpected access to sensitive system functions or files, potentially allowing a low-privileged user to gain higher-level permissions. Administrators may observe abnormal behavior during user sessions or through logs, indicating that standard user accounts could be performing actions typically reserved for administrative roles. These impacts can significantly compromise system integrity and user data confidentiality, stressing the importance of promptly addressing this update. The severity of this issue is marked as 'important', which highlights the need for immediate user awareness and patch deployment to mitigate risks.",
