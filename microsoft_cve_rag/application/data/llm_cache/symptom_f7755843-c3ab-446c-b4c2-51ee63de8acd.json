  "description": "End users may experience significant risks with their systems being remotely exploitable due to a Windows TCP/IP vulnerability (CVE-2024-21416) affecting multiple build versions including Windows 10 and Windows 11. This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute code from a remote location, which could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data or resources. The impacted systems include Windows 10 versions 21H2 and 22H2 with build numbers 10.0.19044.4894 and 10.0.19045.4894, as well as Windows 11 builds such as 10.0.26100.1742 for version 24H2. As a result, system administrators are advised to closely monitor their networks for any unusual activities and ensure that they apply the relevant security patches listed under KB articles KB5043080, KB5043076, and others to mitigate these risks. This situation emphasizes the urgent need for comprehensive patch management to prevent potential exploitation and ensure system integrity and confidentiality.",
