  "description": "After applying the security update KB5039212, users may experience intermittent issues with the Windows Perception Service, which can lead to an elevation of privilege behavior in the system. This observable behavior manifests primarily as unexpected access to sensitive files or functionality that should be restricted to higher privilege accounts. Depending on the affected build, users may notice alterations in file management capabilities, such as creating or deleting files that are normally protected under the 'NT AUTHORITY\\LOCAL SERVICE' account. Systems running Windows 10 versions 21H2 and 22H2, as well as Windows 11 versions 22H2 and 23H2, are particularly noted to exhibit this behavior, where restoration of expected permissions may not occur post-update without further remediation actions. This symptom underscores the importance of closely monitoring user permissions and file integrity in the aftermath of update application.",
