  "description": "The cause of the denial of service vulnerability CVE-2023-35635 stems from a flaw in the Windows kernel that allows an attacker to exploit this vulnerability by having an authenticated user interact with a specially crafted file, either locally or over a network share. Specifically, when the user opens or browses this malicious file on an unpatched version of Windows, it can lead to a crash of the operating system, severely impacting its availability. This issue affects Windows 11 Version 23H2 for x64-based Systems (Build 10.0.22631.2861) and Windows 11 Version 22H2 for x64-based Systems (Build 10.0.22621.2861), as documented in KB-5033375.",
