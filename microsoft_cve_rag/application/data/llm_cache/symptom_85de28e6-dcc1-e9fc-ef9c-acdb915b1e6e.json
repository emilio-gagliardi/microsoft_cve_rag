  "description": "The Windows Mobile Broadband Driver on affected systems can experience a total loss of availability, resulting in a denial of service. This symptom persists either during an ongoing attack or can become a permanent condition, preventing users from establishing new connections while maintaining existing ones. System administrators will notice that devices utilizing the impacted driver become completely unresponsive to network requests, effectively disconnecting users from the network entirely. The issue has been identified in multiple builds, including Windows 11 (Version 24H2 for x64-based systems - build 10.0.26100.2033) and Windows 10 (Version 22H2 for x64-based systems - build 10.0.19045.5011), and is detailed in the respective KB articles (KB5044284, KB5044273). Such behavior may amplify operational disruptions, especially in environments reliant on consistent mobile connectivity.",
