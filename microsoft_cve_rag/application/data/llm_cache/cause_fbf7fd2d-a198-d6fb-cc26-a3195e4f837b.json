  "description": "The vulnerability in the Windows Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS) allows for remote code execution resulting from a numeric truncation error. This error occurs when a larger number is assigned to a variable that cannot accommodate it, leading to unexpected behavior. The affected components are bound to the network stack, permitting exploitation from a remote location with no required interaction from the user.",
