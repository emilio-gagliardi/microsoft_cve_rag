  "description": "After applying the security updates KB5037771, KB5037770, and KB5037768, users may experience unexpected elevations of privilege within the Windows operating system. This behavior can lead to unauthorized access to system-level resources, potentially allowing standard users to perform restricted administrative actions. Such impacts can be observed in Windows 11 Version 23H2 (build 10.0.22631.3593), Windows 10 Version 22H2 (build 10.0.19045.4412), and other specified builds. It is important for system administrators to monitor for unusual activities following the installation of these updates, ensuring that user permissions remain appropriately restricted and that system integrity is maintained as outlined in the CVE-2024-29994 documentation.",
