  "description": "After applying the security updates referenced in KB5046617 and KB5046696, users may encounter unexpected behaviors related to elevation of privileges on their Windows systems, particularly for the Windows 11 builds 10.0.26100.2314, 10.0.22631.4460, and 10.0.22621.4460. This issue is particularly notable with users reporting that processes may gain elevated access levels, causing unauthorized actions to be performed on the system without explicit user consent. Symptoms could manifest as unauthorized system changes leading to instability, application crashes, or failure to enforce security settings. Administrators should monitor affected environments for unusual access patterns or changes in user permissions post-update.",
