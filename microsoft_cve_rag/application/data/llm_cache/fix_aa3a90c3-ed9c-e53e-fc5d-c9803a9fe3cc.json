  "description": "**Fix Overview**:\n\nTo resolve issues during installation, it is recommended to utilize the DISM (Deployment Imaging Service and Management Tool) command to inspect the CBS (Component-Based Servicing) logs. This can help identify potential problems with Windows installation components and assist in restoring system integrity.\n\n1. Open an elevated Command Prompt (Run as Administrator).\n2. Execute the following DISM command to analyze the system:\n   \n   ```\n   DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth\n   ```\n3. Review the CBS logs located at `%windir%\\Logs\\CBS\\CBS.log` to identify and troubleshoot any issues.\n\n**Details**:\n- The DISM command checks the health of the Windows image and may help fix issues that prevent the installation of updates or features. Always ensure to run the command with administrative privileges to avoid permission errors. (LLM Synthesized)\n\n**Preconditions**:\n- Backup important data before proceeding to ensure safety in case of further issues.",
