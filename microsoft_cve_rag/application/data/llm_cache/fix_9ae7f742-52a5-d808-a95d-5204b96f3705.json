  "description": "**Fix Overview**:\n\nTo avoid unexpected consequences related to the use of IPv6 in your systems:\n\n1. Ensure that IPv6 is enabled on all systems.\n2. Review any configurations that may disable IPv6, as this could inadvertently affect your system's operations.\n\n**Details**:\n- Leaving IPv6 enabled is considered best practice as it is increasingly utilized in Microsoft's backend systems. Disabling it could lead to unforeseen issues with connectivity and functionality. \n- Systems that have IPv6 disabled are not impacted by the CVE; however, maintaining it enables full compliance with current networking standards and practices.
