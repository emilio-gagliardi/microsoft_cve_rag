  "description": "The issue arises when users attempt to reinstall Windows 10 on the Surface Pro but encounter errors related to the system's boot sequence. Specifically, the absence of a USB recovery drive can lead to complications in reinstallation. When users fail to create a specially formatted USB recovery drive, it can disrupt the process of booting into the recovery environment necessary for a clean install. Given Microsoft's documentation inadequacies or unawareness of proper USB drive creation steps, users may not effectively restore their systems. This scenario primarily affects Surface Pro devices running various builds of Windows 10 needing reinstallation due to system errors or failures.",
