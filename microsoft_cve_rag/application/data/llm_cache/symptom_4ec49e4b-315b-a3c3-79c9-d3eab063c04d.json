  "description": "A critical remote code execution flaw exists in Windows Hyper-V, identified as CVE-2024-21407, with a CVSS score of 8.1. This vulnerability can be exploited by an authenticated attacker operating from within a guest virtual machine (VM) to execute arbitrary code on the host server. The complexity of the attack is high, requiring the attacker to gather specific environmental information and implement preparatory actions. If successfully exploited, the impact could severely affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability, leading to unauthorized access to read, write, and delete operations on the host. Users of Windows 10 and newer, as well as Windows Server 2012 and newer with the Hyper-V role, are strongly urged to apply the latest updates to mitigate this risk.",
