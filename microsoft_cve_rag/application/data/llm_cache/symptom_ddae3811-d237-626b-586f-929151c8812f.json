  "description": "Users of Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) version 128.0.2739.42 may experience unexpected errors or crashes after installation due to an underlying issue with insufficient data validation in the installer. This issue can manifest as the browser freezing, failing to load certain web applications, or showing error messages indicating an inability to access certain functionalities. Additionally, users might find themselves unable to complete tasks that require elevated privileges because of the privilege escalation risk associated with the affected build. Updates to this version have addressed the specific vulnerabilities found, and users are advised to check their build numbers to ensure they are on the latest, non-vulnerable release indicated in KB-128.0.2739.42.",
