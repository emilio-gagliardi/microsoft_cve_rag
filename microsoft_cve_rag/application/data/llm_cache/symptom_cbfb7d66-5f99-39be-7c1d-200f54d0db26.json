  "description": "Users may experience unexpected changes in system behavior following the application of the security updates related to the kernel streaming WOW thunk service driver. Specifically, Windows 10 builds (10.0.19044.4894, 10.0.22000.3197) and Windows 11 builds (10.0.26100.1742) can demonstrate symptoms of elevated privileges being mistakenly granted, which could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive resources. This scenario could manifest as users encountering erratic functionality, where system permissions suddenly appear to change or user accounts gain access to features or data that were previously restricted. Additional symptoms may include inconsistent application behavior or difficulty in managing permissions, which can contribute to confusion for end-users. Relevant update references include KB5043080, KB5043076, KB5043067, and KB5043064, which provide necessary patches for rectifying this behavior.",
