  "description": "The incident involves a potential security feature bypass that could allow unauthorized access to systems utilizing Secure Boot. System administrators may experience alarming indications of compromised integrity, as an attacker executing this vulnerability could gain access to sensitive resources without proper authorization. As a consequence, administrators might notice inexplicable modifications to system files or configurations, leading to an overall degradation of security posture. This behavior can manifest as unexpected system outages or performance irregularities due to unauthorized access. The impact primarily affects systems running Windows 10 and 11, specifically versions detailed in KB-5040442, KB-5040431, and KB-5040427, suggesting the necessity of immediate remediation and patching based on the published build numbers.",
