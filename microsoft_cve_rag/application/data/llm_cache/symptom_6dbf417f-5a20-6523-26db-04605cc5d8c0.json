  "description": "Lenovo laptops operating on Windows 11 exhibit performance issues, particularly during video meetings in Microsoft Teams. Users have reported that when Teams is actively used in a meeting, the laptops experience high temperatures, causing the fans to operate at maximum speed. This overheating behavior is particularly noticeable on lower-end models, even after performing BIOS updates through Lenovo Vantage and other driver updates. Interestingly, higher-end configurations, such as the Lenovo P14 equipped with 32GB of RAM and a dedicated GPU, do not present these issues. This trend suggests that basic cloud applications require robust hardware for optimal performance without overheating.",
