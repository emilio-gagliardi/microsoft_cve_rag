  "description": "Users may experience unexpected crashes in Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) versions prior to 130.0.6723.58 due to a memory corruption issue related to a use-after-free vulnerability in web authentication. After installing the security update (KB-130.0.2849.46) released on October 17, 2024, users can mitigate this issue by updating to the latest version of Edge. The failure might manifest as sudden termination of the browser during usage, especially when processing complex websites or web applications relying on authentication features. System administrators should ensure that all users have upgraded their browsers to maintain a stable and secure browsing experience. The symptom highlights the necessity of timely updates to prevent disruptions caused by the underlying vulnerability.",
