  "description": "After the installation of security updates KB5046617, KB5046633, and related patches, users may experience elevation of privilege issues within systems that leverage the Windows USB video class system driver. This could manifest as unauthorized access to system functions, where an attacker with physical access could connect a malicious device to exploit the vulnerability. Systems running Windows 11, including builds 10.0.26100.2314, 10.0.22631.4460, and 10.0.22621.4460, along with various Windows Server versions, are particularly affected. The observable behavior for users might include unusual responses when interacting with USB peripherals or application crashes when attempting to use USB video devices. Corrective action is advised to mitigate the risks associated with this significant issue.",
