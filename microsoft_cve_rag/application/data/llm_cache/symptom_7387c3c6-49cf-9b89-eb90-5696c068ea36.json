  "description": "Users may experience unexpected integrity issues when browsing with Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) version 119.0.2151.72 due to a spoofing vulnerability. This can happen if a user clicks on a specially crafted URL, which would allow an attacker to bypass warnings on permission messages when visiting potentially malicious websites. The issue is documented under KB-119.0.2151.72, with build numbers including 119.0.2151.72 for Microsoft Edge and extended stable builds such as 118.0.2088.109.",
