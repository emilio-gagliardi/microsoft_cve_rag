  "description": "The vulnerability stems from a security feature bypass due to untrusted pointer dereference within the Windows Resume Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI), affecting several Windows 10 and Windows 11 builds. Successful exploitation could lead an attacker to bypass secure boot protections by executing a local attack that takes advantage of system-level privileges and improper validation of pointers.",
