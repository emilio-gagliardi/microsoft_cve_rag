  "description": "Users connected to a network using Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects face a significant risk of remote code execution due to a vulnerability that requires user interaction. Specifically, if an authenticated user is tricked into connecting their SQL client application to a malicious SQL database, specially crafted replies from the server can exploit the vulnerability. This results in arbitrary code execution within the context of the user's application. The impacted systems span various Windows 10 and 11 builds, including important KB articles such as KB5034763, affecting builds ranging from 10.0.10240.20469 to 10.0.22631.3155. Such an attack compromises the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the user's resources, leading to potential data breaches and service disruptions.",
