  "description": "**Tool Overview**:  \nThe Windows Security Hardening Assistant guides administrators on implementing security changes to enhance Windows Hello authentication and secure boot management. It assists in configuring settings to adopt strong mapping for certificate-based authentication and prepares the environment for upcoming security enforcements.\n  \n**Details**:  \nThis tool makes implementing security enhancements simpler by providing clear steps for enforcing strong mapping in Active Directory. Additionally, it prepares organizations for the phased removal of vulnerable protocols like TLS 1.0 and 1.1 from Azure storage accounts. The functionality includes checking which systems have been updated and ensuring compliance with new security standards before critical deadlines, starting as early as February 15, 2024. Furthermore, it aids in preparing for the block of unauthorized boot managers by enforcing policy updates that cannot be bypassed.\n  \nPlease refer to relevant documentation to ensure compliance and readiness for the updates and changes described.",
