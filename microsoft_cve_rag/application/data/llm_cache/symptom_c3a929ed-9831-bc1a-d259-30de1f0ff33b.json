  "description": "After upgrading to Microsoft Edge version 127.0.2651.98, users may experience frequent browser crashes or unresponsive behavior. This symptom is particularly evident when accessing websites that rely on audio or video elements, triggering the associated vulnerabilities found in the underlying Chromium component. Users have reported that tabs become unresponsive, and in some cases, the entire browser must be restarted manually, leading to interruptions in workflows and productivity. The stability issues are directly tied to the correction of vulnerabilities listed under CVE-2024-7535, which means that before applying the update, users may have noticed erratic behaviors but may assume the situation improves post-update. System administrators should monitor user feedback closely while ensuring that the latest patches are deployed to mitigate any lingering symptoms from pre-update stability issues.",
