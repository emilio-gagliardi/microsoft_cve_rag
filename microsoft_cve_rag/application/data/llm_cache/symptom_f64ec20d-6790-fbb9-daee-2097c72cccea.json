  "description": "System administrators using Windows Server 2012 R2 may encounter issues applying Extended Security Updates (ESU) after the end of extended support on October 10, 2023. The core problem arises when the necessary updates, including KB5032308 for the November servicing stack update and KB5017220 for the ESU licensing preparation, are not correctly installed. This can lead to the inability to receive critical security patches, exposing the system to potential vulnerabilities despite having previously acquired the ESU licensing.",
