  "description": "The issue stems from the accumulation of residual files and incorrect service states during the Windows Update process, which can lead to update failures and stalled installations. Specifically, the contents of the 'C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution\\Download' folder and the '$Windows.~BT' folder need to be deleted to clear any obsolete or corrupted files that may hinder the Update service. Additionally, the Windows Update service (`wuauserv`) and Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) may require stopping and disabling temporarily to facilitate this cleanup without automatic restarts that could interfere with the process. Restarting the update service afterward and checking the update status ensures a fresh start for the update process. This approach helps resolve issues where updates fail due to mismanaged staging folders and service states, which is critical for maintaining system integrity and performance.",
