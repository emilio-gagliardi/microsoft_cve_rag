  "description": "To address the issue of users ignoring patching reboot prompts, the desktop support team amended the Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to enforce mandatory reboots after a specified period. This change ensures that users are prompted to log off and reboot their machines in a timely manner, thereby streamlining the patch management process and enhancing system security. By enforcing this policy, it mitigates the risk of prolonged exposure to unpatched vulnerabilities due to delayed reboots. The adjustment of the GPO settings aids in maintaining compliance with the organizational patching schedule. This proactive approach significantly reduces instances where systems remain vulnerable due to user inaction regarding updates.",
