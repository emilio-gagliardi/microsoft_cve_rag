  "description": "The system experiences unexpected BitLocker suspension due to a certificate update triggered by Microsoft. This occurs particularly on laptops where UEFI certificates may be impacted. Administrators should review the relevant UEFI certificates and monitor TPM WMI events to identify the cause effectively. A specific concern arises when users enter hibernation instead of performing a complete reboot, which can interfere with the BitLocker suspension counter. This situation may result from Microsoft patches initiating BitLocker suspension after two reboots, potentially leading to security implications if not addressed. The importance of verifying the system's reboot behavior in relation to BitLocker suspension is critical for maintaining data security.",
