  "description": "**Fix Overview**:\n\nTo resolve reboot issues associated with BitLocker on a Windows 10 PC:\n\n1. Identify if any Microsoft account has been associated with the PC.\n2. Check the Microsoft account for a stored recovery key, as it might not be in the original user\u2019s account, but could be found in the account of whoever deployed it, including Entra or Azure AD.\n\n**Details**:\n- The recovery key is crucial for accessing the PC if BitLocker has locked the drive. If you can recover it, you may bypass the reboot issue.\n- It is advisable to keep track of which accounts have interacted with the PC during deployment to facilitate recovery operations.\n",
