  "description": "In Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based), users may experience a risk of UI spoofing when downloading files due to insufficient data validation in earlier versions of Chromium prior to 130.0.6723.58. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to deceive users into interacting with malicious UI elements, which can lead to unauthorized actions. Affected users might notice odd behaviors when downloading files that seem to originate from trusted sources but may not be secure. Ensuring that Edge is updated to version 130.0.6723.59 or later will negate this issue, providing a more secure browsing experience. Administrators should verify that their browser versions align with the latest release to mitigate this risk as noted in KB-130.0.2849.46.",
