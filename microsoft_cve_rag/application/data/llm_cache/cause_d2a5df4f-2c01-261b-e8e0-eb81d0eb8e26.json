  "description": "The underlying cause of CVE-2024-21320 is the improper handling of Windows themes, allowing an attacker to spoof the appearance of the operating system by deceiving the user into interacting with a malicious file disguised as a legitimate theme component. This flaw occurs within the Windows operating system's theme management module, which is exposed to the network stack, enabling remote attackers to potentially exploit the vulnerability without requiring advanced access privileges. The vulnerability requires a user interaction prerequisite, which means that the attacker must first convince the user to execute or manipulate the crafted file, typically through social engineering techniques such as phishing emails or misleading instant messages. The affected products span multiple Windows builds, including versions 10 and 11, specifically impacting builds such as 10.0.19044.3930 and 10.0.22631.3007. The presence of this issue highlights the need for enhanced user awareness and active monitoring of theme files to mitigate spoofing risks effectively.",
