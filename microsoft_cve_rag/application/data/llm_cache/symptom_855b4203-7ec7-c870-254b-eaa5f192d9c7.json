  "description": "The Deployment Image Service and Management Tool (DISM) is unable to function properly due to the sudden disappearance of essential DLLs, specifically 'metadeployprovider.dll' and 'siloedpackageprovider.dll'. This issue has been encountered during attempts to perform top-level upgrades to Windows 11. The underlying cause is a dependency issue wherein these DLLs, listed among the DISM providers, are not found, leading to failures in executing repair installations and imaging commands. The problem may not be easily replicated across different systems, indicating potential variances in Windows Adk installations or configurations. Importantly, this issue can hinder updates and could impact system performance drastically until resolved.",
