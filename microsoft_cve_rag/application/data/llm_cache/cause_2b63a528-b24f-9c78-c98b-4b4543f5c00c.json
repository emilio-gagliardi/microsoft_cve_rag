  "description": "The primary cause of the issue with headphone detection was identified as a mismatch in the headphone plug specifications. The customer used a 3.5mm plug with four terminals, which indicated the presence of an inline microphone. Standard audio jacks are designed to detect headphones with three terminals, leading to no recognition from the Waves Maxx app. Subsequent testing with a simple headphone that has a three-terminal plug also failed. Additionally, there is a suggestion that the laptop's audio jack itself may be faulty, compounding the detection problem. Using a 3.5mm to USB adapter resolved the issue, facilitating compatibility and audio recognition in the software, showcasing the importance of plug configuration in device detection.",
