  "description": "Users may experience issues with audio input and output when an application from Realtek is not installed. This application is crucial as it allows specification of the audio socket being used, whether it is a speaker, headset, or microphone. Without it, the system may default to incorrect configurations, potentially leading to poor audio quality or complete audio device failure. The problem can significantly impact user productivity and engagement, especially in environments reliant on clear audio communications. Ensuring that the appropriate Realtek app is installed could resolve these usability issues.",
