  "symptom_label": "system_privileges_increased_due_to_driver_vulnerability",
  "description": "End users may experience unexpected elevation of privileges on their Windows systems due to an identified vulnerability in the kernel streaming service driver, specifically affecting Windows 10 and Windows 11 versions as detailed in the published security updates. This may manifest as abnormal access to system resources and the potential for unauthorized operations that could compromise user data or alter system settings. Observations of this symptom could include alterations to access permissions or unexpected system behavior following the application of patches related to KB5043080, KB5043076, KB5043067, and KB5043064. Systems affected across build numbers, including 10.0.26100.1742 for Windows 11 and 10.0.19045.4894 for Windows 10, should be closely monitored for signs of privilege escalation as this risk could significantly impact the overall security posture of the environment.",
