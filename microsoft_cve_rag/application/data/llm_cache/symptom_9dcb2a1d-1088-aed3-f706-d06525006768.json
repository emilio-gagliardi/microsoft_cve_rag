  "description": "A Windows 10 virtual machine (VM) running on a vSphere cluster is experiencing failures when attempting to download the Windows 11 upgrade. Despite having ample disk space, the process fails at initiating the update download. Relevant log entries indicate multiple failures within the download manager, leading to an inability to complete key download requests for updates linked to KB articles such as KB3406046 and KB3428049. The specific error messages correspond to handler failures, notably error code c1900200, indicating an issue within the updating mechanism. This prevents the VM from receiving timely software updates, which could degrade overall system performance and security.",
