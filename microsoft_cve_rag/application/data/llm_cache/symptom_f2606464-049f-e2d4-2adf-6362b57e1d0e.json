  "description": "In Microsoft Dynamics 365 (on-premises) version 9.1, users may experience unintended data exposure due to an information disclosure issue. Specifically, any authenticated user could trigger this vulnerability without requiring elevated privileges, allowing them to access data that they normally would not have visibility into. This can lead to serious consequences as all data accessible to the logged-in user can potentially be exfiltrated by an unauthorized actor. The impact of this vulnerability is particularly significant given that sensitive information can be disclosed, reflecting a total loss of confidentiality. This situation emphasizes the importance of immediate updates to version 9.1 and security fix KB-5039459 to mitigate the risk associated with this vulnerability.",
