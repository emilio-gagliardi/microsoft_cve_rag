  "description": "The underlying cause of the Windows Backup app not appearing on an enterprise-managed device after applying a Windows security update released on or after January 25, 2024, is likely linked to a configuration issue initiated by the security update itself. Specifically, the update interacts with the Windows Backup application in a manner that it disables or hides the app from users in managed environments. This misconfiguration can stem from the policies set by system administrators in enterprise settings, which may inadvertently conflict with the changes introduced by the update, as noted in KB-5032038. Administrators should account for these potential conflicts and ensure that management policies align with the updates they deploy. Monitoring the behavior post-update and consulting the KB article will aid in identifying solutions to restore visibility to the Windows Backup app.",
