  "description": "**Fix Overview**:\n\nTo address the requirements for the new ADSync installation:\n\n1. Upgrade the .NET Framework to version 4.7.2, as it is a recommended update beyond the minimum required version of 4.7.1 for ADSync.\n2. Consider removing ADSync from your Domain Controller (DC) and relocating it to a non-DC system to potentially mitigate security concerns.\n\n**Details**:\nUpgrading to a more recent version of the .NET Framework can help ensure compatibility and improve security for ADSync operations. Relocating ADSync away from a DC may reduce the risk of exposure to vulnerabilities typically present in domain environments. (LLM Synthesized)",
