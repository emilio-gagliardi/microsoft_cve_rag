  "description": "After the application of the 24H2 update, users are experiencing issues with the CheckPoint VPN client where the client successfully establishes a connection but subsequently disconnects shortly after. This behavior hampers remote work capabilities and may indicate compatibility issues with the recent operating system update. The problem appears specific to the CheckPoint VPN solution, affecting its ability to maintain a persistent VPN tunnel post-upgrade. Given that these symptoms have been reported collectively among VPN users after the update, further investigation into potential patches or configurations is warranted. Administrators should note any specific error messages or logs generated by the CheckPoint client for troubleshooting purposes.",
