  "description": "Defragmenting SSDs or NVMe drives can lead to a notable reduction in the lifespan of the storage device. Unlike traditional hard drives, SSDs utilize a different architecture that does not require defragmentation for efficiency. Attempting to defragment these types of drives may cause unnecessary wear due to the write cycles involved. System administrators should be cautious about implementing defragmentation routines on SSDs to prevent performance degradation and increased failure rates. This issue predominantly affects systems relying on SSD or NVMe technology, which are common in modern deployments.",
