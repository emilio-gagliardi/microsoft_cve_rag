  "description": "**Tool Overview**:\n\nThis refers to the latest version of Microsoft Edge, which is based on the Chromium open-source software. It is designed to mitigate vulnerabilities such as CVE-2024-9963 by incorporating the latest security updates and patches directly from the Chromium project. \n\n**Details**:\n\nMicrosoft Edge relies on the Chromium engine for rendering web content and therefore inherits vulnerabilities that may affect Chromium. The recent update from Chromium addresses insufficient data validation in downloads, which could allow an attacker to exploit the system. Updating to the latest version of Microsoft Edge ensures that users benefit from these security enhancements and mitigations against such vulnerabilities. It is essential for administrators to regularly check for updates to maintain security integrity in their deployments.",
