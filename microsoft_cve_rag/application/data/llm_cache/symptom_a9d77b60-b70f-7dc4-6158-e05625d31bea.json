  "description": "LDAP clients may experience connectivity issues when attempting to access Active Directory services over SSL if the required certificates are not properly imported into the Active Directory Domain Controllers (DCs). This problem manifests during secure LDAP requests, resulting in failed authentication attempts and potential service outages for client applications relying on these connections. Affected users may receive error messages indicating the inability to establish a secure connection. Important build numbers and publishes instructions from Microsoft indicate that the correct installation and confirmation of the private key is critical for certificate validation. Specifically, administrators should follow Microsoft's guidance to ensure certificates are imported correctly into the personal certificate store.",
