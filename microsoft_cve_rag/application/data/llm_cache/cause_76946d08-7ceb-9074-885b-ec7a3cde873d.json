  "description": "The issue described is related to the absence of a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) during the installation of an operating system. The lack of TPM prevented the upgrade from Windows 10 to Windows 11, which is a requirement for securing sensitive data and enhancing device security. This indicates that the machine in question is either outdated or missing the necessary hardware component, leading to the decision to replace the machine entirely. Such misconfigurations can often result in significant downtime and resource allocation to procure new hardware to meet the installation requirements. It is fundamental for administrators to check for TPM compatibility before attempting to upgrade to Windows 11 to prevent similar issues.",
