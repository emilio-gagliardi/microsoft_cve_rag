  "description": "After applying the security patches identified in KB5040442, KB5040431, and KB5040427, users may observe abnormal access behaviors in applications that rely on image acquisition functionality on Windows 10 and Windows 11. Specifically, affected systems running build numbers 10.0.22631.3880, 10.0.22621.3880, 10.0.19045.4651, and 10.0.19044.4651 can experience unexpected elevation of privileges. This can lead to potential unauthorized access to sensitive areas of the operating system, causing stability issues or unintended consequences in user environments. The issue might manifest as users gaining access to restricted files, allowing modifications that shouldn\u2019t ordinarily be permissible. Consequently, system administrators should closely monitor user reports concerning elevated access claims post-update, especially for systems utilizing the image acquisition services.",
