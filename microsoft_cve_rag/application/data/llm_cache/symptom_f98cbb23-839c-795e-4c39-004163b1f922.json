  "description": "When attempting to apply standard updates, systems may encounter issues if the recovery partition is too small to accommodate the required files. This can lead to failed updates or operational disruptions for the affected machines. The problem is particularly pertinent for environments utilizing specific standard update packages that may not account for existing space limitations, requiring manual intervention to resolve the space issue and successfully complete updates.",
