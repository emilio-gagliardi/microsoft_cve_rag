  "description": "End users may experience unintended access to elevated privileges on systems running the vulnerable Hyper-V VMSwitch component, potentially leading to unauthorized control over the Hyper-V host execution environment. This critical issue affects Windows Server and Windows 11 builds, specifically versions 24H2, 23H2, and 22H2, as detailed in KB articles KB5046696 and KB5046633. Users might notice abnormal behavior in virtual machines, such as security boundary breaches, which could lead to arbitrary code execution from a low privilege Hyper-V guest. It is crucial for system administrators to promptly apply the security updates to mitigate this issue and prevent exploitation.",
