  "description": "There is confusion among users regarding the detection of whether a system has Adobe Acrobat or Adobe Reader installed, as both products now share the same program name. This ambiguity can lead to issues in patch management and software compliance, as system administrators may struggle to differentiate between these applications based on their common registry values. To address this problem, it is essential for administrators to find an accurate method or registry key to confirm the installed version of either product.",
