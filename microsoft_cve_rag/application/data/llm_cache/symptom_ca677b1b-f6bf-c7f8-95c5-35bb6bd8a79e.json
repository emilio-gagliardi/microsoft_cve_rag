  "description": "After the installation of the latest security updates (KB-5044285, KB-5044284, KB-5044280, KB-5044273), users may experience an inability to open Microsoft Saved Console (MSC) files, which have been deemed untrusted due to a vulnerability in the Microsoft Management Console. This behavior occurs on various Windows builds, including Windows 10 (both x64 and 32-bit) and Windows 11 across multiple versions (24H2, 23H2, 22H2, and 21H2). Users observing this symptom will likely notice error messages or prompts indicating that the files cannot be opened. The updates are designed to mitigate risks associated with this security issue, therefore, if the files are not opening, it is a direct consequence of the protective measures implemented by these updates. Users should ensure they have applied the correct updates for their specific Windows build numbers to handle this scenario effectively.",
