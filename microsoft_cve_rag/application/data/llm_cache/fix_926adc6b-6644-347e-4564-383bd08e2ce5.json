  "description": "**Fix Overview**:\n\nTo implement a task sequence using PowerShell for handling patch scripts:\n\n1. Define the RunOnce and DoneKey registry keys:\n   - `$runOnce = 'HKLM:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\RunOnce'`\n   - `$doneKey = 'HKLM:\\Software\\SmithConsulting'`\n\n2. Store your command scripts in the RunOnce key to execute them at startup.\n\n3. Maintain the state of completed tasks using the DoneKey, which allows you to track which scripts have already run.\n\n4. Construct a comprehensive switch statement that processes each task sequentially, ensuring each task is executed once before marking it as complete.\n\nThis approach effectively utilizes the Windows registry to manage the execution of scripts through a state machine method, thereby enabling organized and efficient patch management. (LLM Synthesized)\n\n**Preconditions**:\n- Administrative privileges are required to modify registry keys.\n- Create a backup of the registry before making changes to prevent misconfiguration.",
