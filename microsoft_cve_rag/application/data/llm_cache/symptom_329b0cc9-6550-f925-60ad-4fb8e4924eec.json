  "description": "The observed symptom indicates a performance degradation in virtual machines running on Hyper-V hosts after they are patched. Specifically, administrators have noted that patching the Hyper-V host triggers issues, which leads to a decision to postpone host patching until a resolution is established. Both KB-5031361 and KB-5031364 are relevant as they are linked to the performance problems experienced in Windows Server 2019 environments utilizing Hyper-V technology.",
