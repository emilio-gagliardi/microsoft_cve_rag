  "description": "End users on Windows systems may experience a reduction in the effectiveness of security protocols due to a security feature bypass vulnerability identified as CVE-2024-20652. This issue can lead to unexpected behavior where data intended to be secured may inadvertently be accessed or modified, affecting the integrity and confidentiality of the system. Users running affected builds, including but not limited to Windows 10 (builds 19044.3930, 19045.3930), and Windows 11 (builds 22000.2713, 22631.3007) might notice discrepancies in application behavior or unanticipated access to sensitive data. The behavior arises after security patches associated with KB-5034121, KB-5034122, KB-5034123, and KB-5034134, which aim to address this vulnerability, are applied. System administrators should monitor for any reporting of unusual data access patterns or diminished protective measures post-update as part of their ongoing security oversight.",
