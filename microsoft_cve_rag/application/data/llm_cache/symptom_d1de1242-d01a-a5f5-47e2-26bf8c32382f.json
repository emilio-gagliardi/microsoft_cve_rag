  "description": "Users may experience unauthorized access to system resources, enabling an attacker to gain elevated privileges on affected Windows systems. This condition can lead to severe implications, including the ability to modify sensitive files and settings without user consent. The impacted products include various builds of Windows 10 and Windows 11, specifically those identified with build numbers such as 10.0.19045.4412 and 10.0.22000.2960. Affected KB Articles such as KB-5037788 and KB-5037771 provide further details on the mitigations necessary to address this issue. The observable behavior of unauthorized modifications or actions on the device can strike at the core of system integrity, creating serious trust and security concerns for administrators.",
