  "description": "End users may experience unauthorized remote code execution while connected to a malicious SQL database using affected Microsoft WDAC OLE DB Provider for SQL Server. This situation necessitates user action, where an authenticated victim is tricked into establishing a connection to the malicious database. Upon this connection, the server can respond with crafted packets that exploit the underlying vulnerability, allowing execution of arbitrary code within the context of the user\u2019s SQL client application. This could lead to severe impacts, including unauthorized modification of files or denial of service within the impacted component. Relevant build numbers affected include 10.0.19045.4046, 10.0.10240.20469, and 10.0.22631.3155, with a corresponding KB Article ID of KB5034763.",
