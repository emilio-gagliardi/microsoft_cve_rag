  "description": "The underlying cause of the patching issue stemmed from users consistently failing to log off and disregarding the reboot prompts that were triggered after patch installations. This issue resulted in prolonged system vulnerability as necessary patches were not applied in a timely manner. The desktop support team recognized the need for intervention and altered the Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to enforce mandatory reboots following patch installations. By implementing this change, they aimed to ensure that users complied with the reboot prompts, thereby facilitating effective patch management. This approach directly addresses the challenge of user behavior that interfered with system updates, highlighting the importance of both technical policies and user compliance in managing patches effectively.",
