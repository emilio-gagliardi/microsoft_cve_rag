  "description": "Users may experience unauthorized access or unintended privilege escalations on systems running affected versions of Windows following the installation of the security updates identified in KB5040442, KB5040431, and KB5040427. Specifically, this impact affects Windows 11 and Windows 10 builds including 10.0.22631.3880 and 10.0.19045.4651, among others. Administrators should be vigilant as attackers could exploit this vulnerability to gain elevated privileges in user contexts, potentially leading to unauthorized modifications or access to sensitive resources. This could disrupt normal operations and security posture across the affected environments. End users may notice unusual behavior from applications that could be a direct result of elevated privileges being misused or accessed improperly.",
