  "description": "The installation process for the updates related to KB-5041580 fails to complete, potentially due to issues with the automatic upgrade feature. During this process, users may encounter obstacles when performing the installation quietly or in a non-interactive mode. It is critical that the PowerShell commands used for mounting and starting the setup are executed correctly, as improper command syntax can prevent successful installation. This issue could specifically affect those managing Windows-based systems that rely on the auto upgrade functionality for patch management. Ensuring adherence to the build requirements and proper command usage is essential for resolving this installation failure.",
