  "description": "After the security update related to the Windows Power Dependency Coordinator identified in CVE-2024-38107, users may encounter issues that allow unauthorized actions to elevate privileges in Windows 11 Version 24H2 (Build 10.0.26100.1457). System administrators have reported that despite implementing patches via KB-5041571, the operating system continues to exhibit behavior wherein users can unintentionally gain elevated permissions, which may lead to unauthorized access to sensitive resources. This impact is significant as it may compromise the integrity and confidentiality of user data. Additionally, related versions of Windows 11 and Windows Server 2012 R2 may reflect similar behaviors despite the application of the relevant monthly rollups listed under KB-5041828, thus demanding careful monitoring and further troubleshooting. It is crucial for professionals to ensure all relevant updates are applied to mitigate potential exploitation scenarios.",
