  "description": "Users may experience unauthorized information disclosure when using Windows operating systems affected by the vulnerability outlined in CVE-2024-21311. This issue results in the potential exposure of sensitive information as an attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can access small portions of heap memory. This behavior is not explicitly visible to end-users but can lead to significant security risks as information that should remain confidential may be compromised. The affected products include multiple builds of Windows 10 (version 21H2: 10.0.19044.3930, version 22H2: 10.0.19045.3930), Windows 11 (version 21H2: 10.0.22000.2713, version 22H2: 10.0.22621.3007), along with servidores running Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2008 R2. For further details, see KB articles KB-5034134, KB-5034123, KB-5034122, and KB-5034121 for possible workarounds and updates to mitigate the risk.",
