  "description": "Users may experience unauthorized access to elevated privileges on Windows systems due to the client-side caching vulnerability (CVE-2024-43644). This flaw can allow an attacker, with basic user permissions, to gain complete control over sensitive resources or modify critical files. Such behaviors could manifest as unexpected changes in system configuration or user permissions, and may potentially lead to denial of access to certain applications or data. The vulnerability affects multiple build versions, including Windows 10 (versions 19044 and 19045) and various versions of Windows 11, as detailed in multiple KB articles (KB-5046696, KB-5046633, KB-5046617, KB-5046613). Therefore, administrators are advised to monitor systems for unusual activity or unauthorized access attempts following patch installations.",
