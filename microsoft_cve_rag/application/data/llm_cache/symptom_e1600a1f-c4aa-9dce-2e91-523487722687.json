  "description": "After users open a specially crafted file, they may notice that certain files within their Windows Compressed Folders are altered or corrupted. Users could experience unexpected changes to file contents, leading to a significant loss of data integrity.

The issue is present in Windows 11 version 22H2 and 23H2 for both x64 and ARM64 architectures, as detailed in KB5035853. This symptom highlights issues related to user-executed actions that can lead to substantial impacts on file integrity and system trustworthiness.",
