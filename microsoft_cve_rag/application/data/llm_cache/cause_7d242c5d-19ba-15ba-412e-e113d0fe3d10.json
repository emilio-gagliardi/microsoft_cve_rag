  "description": "The underlying cause of CVE-2024-20663 is a design flaw in the Windows Message Queuing Client (MSMQC), which allows for information disclosure through insufficiently protected memory regions. Specifically, this issue arises from the vulnerability of certain heap memory areas that can be accessed remotely, facilitating an attack vector that is network-bound. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability without requiring user interaction or specialized access privileges. The software builds affected include those across multiple Windows versions, allowing potential attackers access to sensitive information through small portions of memory. The problem is exacerbated due to the component's exposure to the internet, and the vulnerability's straightforward exploitability makes it critical for organizations to apply patches provided in the corresponding KB Articles (e.g., KB-5034134, KB-5034123).",
