  "description": "Users experience intermittent network outages and service disruptions when interacting with virtual machines hosted on affected builds with Microsoft Virtual Machine Bus (VMBus). Notably, this condition manifests in build numbers 10.0.19045.4291, 10.0.19044.4291, 10.0.22631.3447, 10.0.22000.2899, and 10.0.22621.3447. The Denial of Service vulnerability can lead to system responsiveness delays and application failures, particularly in environments that utilize Microsoft virtualization technologies. Administrators reviewing KB articles such as KB-5036910 and KB-5036909 may find guidance on remediation, but these outages significantly impact workload performance and user experience. As systems remain unstable, the overall productivity of virtualized environments suffers, heightening the urgency for applying relevant patches promptly.",
