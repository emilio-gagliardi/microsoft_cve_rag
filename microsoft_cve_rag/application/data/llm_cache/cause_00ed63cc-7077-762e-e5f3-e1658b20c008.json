  "description": "The cause of the onboarding failure for new Windows 11, version 24H2 devices to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint is primarily due to the prerequisite feature not being enabled or installed. This problem specifically affects devices that either come with the Home SKU, which does not support Defender, or those that have the Pro SKU but where the OEM did not include the necessary Defender features in the base image. As a result, devices may not be enrolled correctly in the Defender service, leading to a lack of protection and compliance issues with conditional access policies. The kernel of this issue stems from changes in the base image for Windows 11, version 24H2, where Defender has been removed by design, necessitating manual installation for proper functionality. IT administrators must utilize the Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tool to rectify this by installing the Windows Sense client using the appropriate command line inputs, as outlined in KB-5043950.",
