  "description": "The core technical cause of CVE-2024-20680 is an information disclosure vulnerability due to improper handling of memory in the Windows Message Queuing Client (MSMQC). This vulnerability allows an attacker to potentially read small portions of heap memory during network communications. The issue arises primarily within the vulnerable component that is bound to the network stack, allowing exploitation from remote attackers with minimal privileges required. Specifically, exploitation does not necessitate user interaction, making it markedly more severe as attackers can target systems over the internet without any prior conditions. Affected products include various Windows 10 and Windows Server versions, highlighting build numbers such as 10.0.19044.3930 and 10.0.22000.2713, and is documented in several KB articles including KB-5034134 and KB-5034123.",
