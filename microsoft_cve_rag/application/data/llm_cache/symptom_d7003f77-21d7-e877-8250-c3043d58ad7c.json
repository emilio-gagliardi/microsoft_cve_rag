  "description": "Users may experience a total loss of availability of the Windows system when attempting to use certain themes due to the denial of service vulnerability identified as CVE-2024-30065. This issue affects several builds of Windows 10 and Windows 11, including versions 22H2 (10.0.19043.4529), 21H2 (10.0.22000.3019), and the latest 23H2 (10.0.22631.3737). When users apply specific themes, they might find that the system becomes completely unresponsive or that access to their resources is irretrievably denied. The inability to use themed interfaces may frustrate end users, leading to disruptions in their workflow. This Symptom is addressed in KB5039212 for various operating system versions, pointing to the importance of keeping systems updated to mitigate such issues.",
