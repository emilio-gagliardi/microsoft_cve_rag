  "description": "After applying Windows security updates released on July 9, 2024, Windows Servers may experience issues with Remote Desktop connectivity, particularly when using legacy protocols like Remote Procedure Call over HTTP. This symptom is characterized by intermittent disruptions in Remote Desktop connections, potentially causing logon sessions to drop every 30 minutes. System administrators may observe that the TSGateway service becomes unresponsive, with an exception code of 0xc0000005 being generated. This may require immediate remediation actions, such as configuring firewalls to block certain connection types or editing registry settings on client devices to mitigate the disruption until an appropriate Microsoft update can be deployed.",
