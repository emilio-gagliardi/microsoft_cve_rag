  "description": "The underlying issue arises from the fact that Acrobat and Acrobat Reader store their settings in different registry keys. This can lead to confusion when determining which application is installed, particularly in scenarios where both applications are present on the same system. The detection process becomes cumbersome as administrators must manually inspect registry paths. Typically, Acrobat executable is found in 'C:\\Program Files\\Adobe' while Acrobat Reader resides in distinct folders. The conflict in registry settings may cause misidentification of application functionality or user settings, potentially affecting user experience and operations. This inconsistency emphasizes the need for enhanced detection mechanisms in patch management workflows to improve accuracy in software inventory management.",
