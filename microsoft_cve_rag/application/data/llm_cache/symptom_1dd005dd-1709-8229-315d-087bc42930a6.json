  "description": "Domain-joined users are unexpectedly receiving prompts to upgrade to Windows 11, which impact user operations and could lead to unplanned disruptions. This behavior is in contrast to previous policies where being a domain member typically shielded users from upgrade invitations. The posts hint at a change in Microsoft's upgrade strategy, specifically referenced in KB4069463, indicating that legacy configurations may no longer suffice for upgrade restrictions. System administrators need to evaluate their update management policies to mitigate unwanted upgrades and ensure proper compliance with organizational IT standards. This shift could influence deployment schedules and necessitate additional training or communication with users about the upgrade process.",
