  "description": "After migrating a CPU-intensive SQL Server (MS 2017) instance from VMware ESXi to Hyper-V 2022, the virtual machine's CPU utilization spikes to 100% and stays between 90% and 100%, resulting in significantly poor performance. This indicates a potential issue with how Hyper-V handles CPU resources compared to VMware ESXi, which may not allocate resources effectively under failover conditions. Such high CPU usage can lead to sluggish performance, impacting the responsiveness of SQL queries and overall server operations. Administrators managing SQL Server workloads on Hyper-V should examine CPU allocation settings and performance metrics to identify any configuration mismatches that result in this excessive utilization. Further investigation into the differences in CPU resource handling between these environments is needed to optimize performance.",
