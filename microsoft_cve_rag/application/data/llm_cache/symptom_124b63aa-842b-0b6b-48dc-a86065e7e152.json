  "description": "After applying the security updates documented in KB-5035858, KB-5035854, KB-5035853, and KB-5035845, users may experience unexpected behaviors that hinder normal operations. Specifically, there is an observable risk of unauthorized elevation of privilege, potentially allowing a local user to gain higher access rights within the system. This issue impacts multiple Windows 10 and Windows 11 versions, including 10.0.19045.4170, 10.0.19044.4170, 10.0.22000.2836, and 10.0.22631.3296. Administrators should monitor for unexpected changes in user permissions or access to sensitive resources following the installation of these updates. Failure to address this may result in system integrity risks and unauthorized access to controlled data or functionalities.",
