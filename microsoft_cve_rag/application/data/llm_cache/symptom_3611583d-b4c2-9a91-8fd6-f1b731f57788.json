  "description": "When normal users are restricted from adding machines to the domain, it may indicate a hardening measure aimed at enhancing domain security. This change can lead to challenges during machine deployment or onboarding, as only accounts with domain admin privileges can perform these operations. If not managed properly, this situation could create operational delays and hinder user productivity, especially in environments where normal user account activity is needed for machine registration. In high-security contexts, this may be a necessary step to mitigate risks associated with unauthorized device additions to the domain. It is vital for system administrators to ensure that domain admin accounts are readily available and that end-users are informed regarding these changes to manage expectations efficiently.",
