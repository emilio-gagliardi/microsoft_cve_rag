  "description": "When attempting to install the Windows Recovery Environment update for Windows 10 versions 21H2 and 22H2, users may encounter an installation failure despite having sufficient free space. According to KB Article KB-5034441, the update requires 250 MB of free space in the recovery partition, yet users have reported that installations fail even when they have over 300 MB available. This issue indicates a potential problem in how the update checks for available disk space in the recovery partition, leading to frustration for system administrators managing this deployment.",
