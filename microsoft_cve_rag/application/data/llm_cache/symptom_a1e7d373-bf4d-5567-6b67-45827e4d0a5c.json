  "description": "The transition to OAuth2 authentication for Outlook.com accounts may lead to connectivity issues for users relying on normal password authentication in their email clients. As Microsoft phases out support for POP3 and IMAP access using standard passwords, users not using compatible 3rd party clients\u2014such as Thunderbird or Apple Mail configured for OAuth2\u2014will encounter failures in synchronizing their Outlook.com type email accounts. This situation affects users with accounts from outlook, live, hotmail, and msn domains, resulting in potential disruptions in email access and management. Administrators should prepare for these changes by ensuring users are migrated to supported authentication methods to avoid loss of access to their email. Refer to the relevant Microsoft documentation for further guidelines on modern authentication requirements.",
