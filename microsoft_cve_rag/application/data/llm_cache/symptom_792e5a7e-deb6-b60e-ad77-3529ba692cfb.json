  "description": "After the installation of the updates associated with KB-5036925, KB-5036910, KB-5036909, KB-5036896, KB-5036894, KB-5036893, and KB-5036892 on affected Windows builds (10.0.19045.4291, 10.0.19044.4291, 10.0.22631.3447, 10.0.22000.2899, 10.0.22621.3447, and 10.0.10240.20596), users may experience an inability to boot their systems. This occurs due to a security feature bypass that affects the secure boot functionality, leading to unexpected system failures or errors during the startup process. System administrators may notice that devices fail to start properly, displaying error messages or freezing mid-boot. The problem is especially pronounced in systems relying heavily on secure boot protocols for system integrity verification, causing a significant disruption in operational capabilities. Troubleshooting this issue may involve reviewing event logs for related error codes and ensuring that all relevant updates have been applied to restore system functionality.",
