  "description": "**Tool Overview**:\n\nThe WinREUpdateInstaller is an executable utility designed to manually install Windows recovery environment updates that may fail during automatic installation. \n\n**Functionality**:\nThe tool allows users to resolve BitLocker and secure boot issues when automatic updates do not succeed. The tool can be found in the `C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution\\Download` folder, often with a random hexadecimal name and no extension. Once located, it can be renamed and executed to run silently. Monitoring can be performed through the Task Manager's details tab to assess the installation progress. \n\n**Usage**:\n1. Navigate to `C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution\\Download` to find the update file.\n2. Rename the file to `winreupdateinstaller.exe`.\n3. Right-click the executable and select 'Run as administrator'.\n4. Verify installation completion using the provided PowerShell command before and after execution to check the Windows recovery image build version for accuracy.\n\nFor syntax confirmation and details related to the Windows imaging command, please refer to the official Microsoft documentation.\n\n",
