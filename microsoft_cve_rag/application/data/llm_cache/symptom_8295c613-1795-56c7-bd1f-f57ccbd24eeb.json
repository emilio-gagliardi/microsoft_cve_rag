  "description": "The SQL Server patching process necessitates handling two distinct types of updates for each version: a cumulative (CU) update and a general distribution release (GDR) update. This specific procedure mandates that the CU update be applied prior to the GDR update, which can lead to confusion or missteps if not carefully managed. System administrators using Configuration Manager (ConfigMgr) for these updates may experience difficulties in executing the required deployments correctly. Furthermore, typical practices within this realm often involve system reboots between the deployment of the updates, a necessity that the database team has flagged. This could result in prolonged downtime or ineffectual updates if not appropriately addressed. The KB article associated with this particular patching scenario is KB95811.",
