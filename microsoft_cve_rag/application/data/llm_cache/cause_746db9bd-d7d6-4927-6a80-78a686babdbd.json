  "description": "The issue arises due to a misconfiguration in Excel 2016 following the installation of the security update KB5002653 on November 12, 2024. After this update, Excel add-ins that were previously enabled do not load correctly when the application is reopened. This problem was confirmed during internal testing by Microsoft patch testers. As a workaround, Microsoft recommends manually downloading and installing update KB4484305 from the Microsoft download center to restore add-in functionality. Notably, this fix is not available through the catalog or configuration manager, complicating the remedial steps for users.",
