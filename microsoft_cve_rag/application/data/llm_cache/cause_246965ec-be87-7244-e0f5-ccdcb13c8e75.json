  "description": "The underlying issue stems from a misconfiguration during the device assignment process in the Intune portal. When a new user is assigned to a device without performing an appropriate autopilot wipe, the device may retain previous configurations and applications that are not suitable for the new user. This misconfiguration leads to inconsistencies in the user experience and could potentially hinder the full functionality of applications that are specific to an individual user profile. Therefore, the recommended solution includes performing an autopilot wipe to ensure that the device is properly reset and reconfigured for optimal performance under the new user's account. Ideally, IT administrators should sequence their standard experience in Intune to facilitate the automatic installation of required apps after the wipe, ensuring that the new user receives a clean and functional setup.",
