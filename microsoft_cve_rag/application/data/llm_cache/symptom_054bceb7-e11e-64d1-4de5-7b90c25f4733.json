  "description": "After the installation of Microsoft Visual Studio updates, users may observe the ability for unauthorized processes to gain elevated privileges. This is particularly concerning for versions 17.4, 17.6, 17.8, and 17.10 of Visual Studio 2022, as well as Visual Studio 2019 (version 16.11) and Visual Studio 2017 (version 15.9). The potential elevation of privileges can result in end-users experiencing unauthorized access to sensitive system functionalities, compromising both confidentiality and integrity. The updates provided in the security patches (KB-16.11.37) are aimed at addressing this serious issue, ensuring that developers using the Wix Toolset within Visual Studio can operate in a more secure environment. System administrators are advised to monitor their installations for any attempts at privilege escalation following these patches.",
