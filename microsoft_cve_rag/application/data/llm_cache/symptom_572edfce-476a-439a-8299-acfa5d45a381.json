  "description": "Users are experiencing issues with opening .xlsx files that appear to be DRM encrypted using Office 2016 Excel. This symptom can be critical, as it prevents users from accessing potentially important data within those spreadsheets. The problem may arise in environments where Enhanced Protected View is enabled, thereby restricting access to files without explicit permissions. Affected users may see error messages indicating that the file is encrypted and cannot be accessed. Repeated attempts to open the file typically yield the same result, hindering productivity and workflow related to data handling and reporting.",
