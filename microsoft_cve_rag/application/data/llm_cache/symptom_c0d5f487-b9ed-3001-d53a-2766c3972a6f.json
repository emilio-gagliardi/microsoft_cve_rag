  "description": "Users of Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) version 124.0.2478.51 may experience potential exposure of sensitive information due to the information disclosure vulnerability identified as CVE-2024-29987. This vulnerability can result in unauthorized access to privately held personal data if users inadvertently engage with specially crafted URLs. The observable behavior may manifest as unexpected prompts or messages requesting user interaction, which could lead to the system revealing confidential details to an attacker. Since user interaction is a prerequisite for exploitation, users may notice that their web activities involve higher risks when opening unfamiliar or untrusted links. Consequently, this raises concerns for users who manage sensitive data through the browser, as it diminishes their confidence in the security of their personal information while using Edge.",
