  "description": "The underlying cause of the slowness issue experienced on over 100 machines after installing the March 2024 security update (KB-5035853) for Windows 11 23H2 appears to be related to the impacts of the update itself. Specifically, users reported significant performance degradation, which wasn't resolved by standard troubleshooting methods such as the core isolation adjustments that were widely suggested. Instead, system administrators found that performing a series of system checks using 'sfc /scannow' followed by an in-place upgrade effectively restored functionality. This suggests that the update may have introduced a regression or misconfiguration that primarily affects systems on the latest build, confirming that recent updates can inadvertently disrupt established system performance.",
