  "description": "The cause of CVE-2023-35632 is rooted in the Windows Ancillary Function Driver for Winsock, which has an elevation of privilege vulnerability allowing local and remote attackers to exploit the system by leveraging read, write, or execute capabilities. This vulnerability stems from a failure to properly restrict permissions in certain built versions of the Windows operating system, notably affecting build numbers 10.0.10240.20345, 10.0.19044.3803, and others related to Windows Server 2008 R2 and later versions. The potential for exploitation does not require user interaction, heightening the risk. The confirmed security patches are documented in KB-5033379 and KB-5033372, aimed at rectifying the flawed permissions management in the driver.",
