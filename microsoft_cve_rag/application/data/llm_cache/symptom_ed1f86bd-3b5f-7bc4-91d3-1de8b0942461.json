  "description": "Users are experiencing difficulties in locating VMware patches on the Broadcom support site. This problem significantly impacts the ability to download necessary patches to ensure systems are up-to-date and secure. Despite having access to entitlements for full ISOs and licenses, users cannot find the specific VMware patches. The issue is compounded by ineffective communication with Broadcom support, which resulted in unclear guidance on navigating their site. This can halt critical updates and maintenance for environments relying on VMware products.",
