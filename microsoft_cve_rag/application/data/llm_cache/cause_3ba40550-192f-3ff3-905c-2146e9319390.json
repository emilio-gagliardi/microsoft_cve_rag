  "description": "The underlying cause of the notification display issue related to the Backup Reminder stems from a misconfiguration in the Windows Registry settings. Specifically, the registry key located at 'HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Notifications\\Settings\\Windows.SystemToast.BackupReminder' has an enabled value of '1', which triggers the unnecessary backup reminder notifications. By modifying this registry value to '0', the notifications can be suppressed, effectively addressing the user's concern. This solution is applicable to builds that utilize this notification mechanism, ensuring that users do not experience interruptions from unwanted prompts. Therefore, adjusting the registry settings can serve as an effective remedy for the related user experience concerns.",
