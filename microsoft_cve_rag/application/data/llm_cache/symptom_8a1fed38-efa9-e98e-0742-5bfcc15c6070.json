  "description": "After upgrading from build 23H2 to 24H2 using the ISO file, users may experience a failure in the DHCP client resulting in a timeout. This issue prevents the network from being recognized or connected post-upgrade. The DHCP client is supposed to automatically obtain an IP address, but due to this failure, it does not successfully retrieve DHCP options. This symptom is notable especially in environments where stable network connections are critical for operational tasks. Further testing and resolution steps may be needed to re-establish network functionalities after encountering this symptom.",
