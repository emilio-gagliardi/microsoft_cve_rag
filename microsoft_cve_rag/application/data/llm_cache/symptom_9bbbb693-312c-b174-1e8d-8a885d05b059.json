  "description": "After updating to Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) version 122.0.2365.52, users may experience navigational errors caused by an inappropriate implementation in navigation within the integrated Chromium component. These errors manifest as the browser not correctly following user commands or displaying incorrect pages when attempting to navigate to familiar URLs. Such behavior may lead users to believe that the browser is malfunctioning or that a network issue exists. The update resolves this concern, ensuring users can navigate reliably and securely to their desired destinations without interference from prior vulnerabilities.\n\nThis issue was assigned the CVE ID CVE-2024-1674 and documented in the Microsoft Knowledge Base under article KB-122.0.2365.52, providing further guidance on addressing these changes post-update. Administrators should monitor their environments after applying updates to confirm that user experiences remain stable and satisfactory following the application of security patches.",
