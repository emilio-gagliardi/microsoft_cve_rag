  "description": "Users may experience unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information due to a vulnerability in the Windows graphics component. This issue affects multiple Windows versions, including Windows 10 and Windows 11. After opening a malicious file crafted by an attacker, users might unknowingly allow small portions of heap memory to be accessed, leading to potential exposure of confidential data. This can result in significant privacy concerns and compromise user security since confidential resources may be divulged. The affected build numbers include 10.0.22631.4317 for Windows 11 and various builds for Windows 10, with associated KB Articles KB5044284, KB5044285, and KB5044286 outlining mitigation steps.",
