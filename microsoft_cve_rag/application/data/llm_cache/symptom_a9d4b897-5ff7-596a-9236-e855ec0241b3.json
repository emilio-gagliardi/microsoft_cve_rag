  "symptom_label": "pc_health_app_fails_due_to_registry_settings",
  "description": "The PC Health app fails to run if there are any registry settings in place that manage Windows updates. This issue arises when the app detects that updates are being controlled by system settings, preventing the app from functioning properly. Unlike the Windows 10 assistant, which may exhibit different behavior, the PC Health app strictly requires that updates be managed in a specific manner to operate. This symptom can lead to user frustration, especially for those trying to utilize the app for system health checks or upgrades. The inability to utilize the PC Health app restricts access to essential system upgrade functionalities, which is particularly relevant for Windows 10 users moving to Windows 11.",
