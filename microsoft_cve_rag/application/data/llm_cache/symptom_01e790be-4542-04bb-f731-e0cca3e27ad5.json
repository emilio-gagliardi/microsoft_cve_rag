  "description": "After the security update, users may experience situations where the Windows Smartscreen feature doesn't provide adequate protection against potentially malicious files. This symptom manifests when an attacker tricks the user into opening a harmful file, successfully bypassing the typical safeguards that are expected from the security feature. As a result, these malicious files could execute without triggering alerts typically meant to protect users, leading to possible unauthorized changes to system files. Users on Windows 10 versions 21H2 and 22H2 for x64-based systems, as well as Windows Server 2016, may encounter this issue as detailed in KB5043064. It is imperative for system administrators to ensure that updates are applied to mitigate this risk and maintain the integrity of user systems.",
