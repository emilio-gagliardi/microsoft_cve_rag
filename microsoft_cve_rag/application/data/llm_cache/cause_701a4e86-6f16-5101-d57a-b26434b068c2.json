  "description": "The cause of the issue with the ESU update installation stems from the SPP service component, specifically located at 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\spp\\tokens\\rules'. In particular, if the ESU key employed does not permit the installation of ESU updates for the upcoming month, this condition must be addressed by utilizing corresponding patch updates KB-5031419 or KB-5031407. These updates fundamentally enhance the capability of the sppsvc component to support the ESU MAK (Microsoft Activation Key) addon, enabling the required update functionalities. Without these updates, systems will potentially face interruptions or failures in receiving critical security updates designed for proper maintenance and compliance. Thus, the root of the failure lies in the interaction between the ESU key settings and the functionality provided by the patches mentioned.",
