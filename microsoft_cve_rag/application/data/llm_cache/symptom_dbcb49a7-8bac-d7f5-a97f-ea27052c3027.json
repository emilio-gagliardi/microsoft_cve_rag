  "description": "Users may notice unexpected behavior in the Microsoft Edge browser, particularly during the autofill process. This could manifest as deceptive UI elements that trick users into providing sensitive information. The issue arises from an inappropriate implementation in the autofill feature of the Chromium-based Microsoft Edge version 131.0.2903.48. Users might be misled by altered visual cues in the browser, potentially leading to compromised security if the user engages with these spoofed elements. This behavior is directly linked to CVE-2024-11111 prior to the release of the secure update associated with KB-131.0.2903.48, indicating the seriousness of the visual manipulation issues in the browser interface.",
