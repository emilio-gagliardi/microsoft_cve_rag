  "description": "End users may experience unauthorized access to system resources, resulting from a kernel-mode driver vulnerability. This elevation of privileges could manifest as unexpected variations in system behavior or unauthorized modifications to settings that should be protected. Users may find that their settings change without their knowledge, or they notice unusual application behavior or performance drops. Such symptoms could lead to potential data breaches if sensitive information is inadvertently exposed or modified. The issue primarily affects Windows 10 and Windows 11 builds including versions 10.0.22631.3880 (KB5040442), 10.0.22621.3880 (KB5040431), and 10.0.19045.4651 (KB5040427).",
