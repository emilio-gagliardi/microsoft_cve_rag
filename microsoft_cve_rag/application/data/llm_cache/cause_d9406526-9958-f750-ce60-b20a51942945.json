  "description": "The underlying cause identified in this context is the absence of separate enablement packages for Windows 11 versions 21H2 and 22H2. Instead, the update process merges functionalities, delivering Windows 11 version 23H2 x64 2023 directly through a unified package. This is crucial as it indicates a shift in the update strategy, where the needed files for 21H2 will now be bundled in a full upgrade rather than requiring separate enablement packages. This means administrators must manage the deployment of the cumulative updates (LCUs) along with the enablement package, KB5027397, effectively simplifying yet complicating the update process due to intertwined dependencies. Legacy systems or environments relying on distinct packages might face challenges unless adaptations to the new process are made, potentially affecting compatibility and user experience during updates.",
