  "description": "During the deployment of a recent patch, the pilot machines successfully installed the update, but concerns were raised regarding the potential failure of older systems, often referred to as \"prehistoric machines.\" The context suggests that these legacy devices may experience compatibility issues related to the patch, indicating that not all machines within the infrastructure are uniformly upgradable. This is especially critical as the update process involves significant dependencies and configurations that may not be adequately supported on older hardware, potentially leading to installation failures.",
