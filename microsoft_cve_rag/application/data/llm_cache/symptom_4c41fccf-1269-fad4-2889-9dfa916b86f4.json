  "description": "Users may experience unexpected elevation of privileges when using PowerShell, which allows unauthorized access to sensitive resources or settings. This behavior can manifest as users gaining access privileges that should be restricted, potentially leading to unauthorized changes in system configurations. The issue is present in multiple builds, including Windows 11 version 23H2 (10.0.22631.3880), Windows 10 version 22H2 (10.0.19045.4651), and Windows 11 version 21H2 (10.0.22000.3079). Users and system administrators should refer to KB5040442, KB5040427, and KB5040431 for further guidance and mitigation strategies. Without timely action, this elevation of privilege can compromise security and integrity within the affected environments.",
