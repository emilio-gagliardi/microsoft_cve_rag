  "description": "In a Microsoft System Center environment running Windows Server 2012 R2, users are experiencing an issue where previously installed patches, both security and non-security updates, are being pushed and installed again. Specifically, the September monthly rollup patch that was successfully installed on September 24, 2023, was re-installed on September 29, 2023, indicating a potential flaw in the patch management process that may disrupt workflows and require unnecessary reboots. This issue could also affect patches installed long before, with some dating back to 2014, causing further administrative challenges.",
