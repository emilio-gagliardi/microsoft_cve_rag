  "description": "In VMware-based virtualization environments, virtual machines (VMs) configured with an x86-based processor and Secure Boot enabled experience a critical failure to boot following the application of recent mitigations. This issue is directly linked to changes associated with the KB-5025885 article, which addresses the revocation of the Windows Boot Manager necessary for Secure Boot operations. The failure to boot poses significant operational impacts, as the affected VMs become inaccessible, preventing end users and system administrators from conducting normal workflows or performing necessary maintenance tasks. Microsoft has acknowledged this issue and is actively coordinating with VMware to devise a resolution. Such scenarios highlight the need for administrators to assess the implications of enabling Secure Boot in their virtual environments, especially in light of recent updates.",
