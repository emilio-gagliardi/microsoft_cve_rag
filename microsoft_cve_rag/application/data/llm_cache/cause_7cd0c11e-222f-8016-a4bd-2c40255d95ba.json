  "description": "The underlying technical issue associated with CVE-2023-6508 is a use-after-free vulnerability located within the media stream component of Chromium, which is utilized by Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based). This flaw occurs when an object is accessed after it has been freed, leading to potential memory corruption and exploitation. Specifically, the issue was addressed in build version 120.0.2210.61 of Microsoft Edge, as documented in KB-120.0.2210.61. This update ensures that Microsoft Edge no longer inherits this vulnerability from the underlying Chromium architecture. Therefore, users are advised to run the latest version of Microsoft Edge to mitigate these risks effectively.",
