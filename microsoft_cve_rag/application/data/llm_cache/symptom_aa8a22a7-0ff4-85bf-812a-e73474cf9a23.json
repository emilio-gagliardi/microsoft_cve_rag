  "description": "Users may experience unauthorized access attempts via a malicious wireless network. This vulnerability in the Windows WLAN Autoconfig service (CVEs 2024-38143) allows an attacker to potentially interact with the system from the lock screen without any prior authentication. Although such an attack does not crash the system or allow unauthorized access in the traditional sense, there is a risk of sensitive information being leaked as a result of this exploitation. Affected products include Windows 10 versions 1607, 22H2, 21H2, and Windows 11 versions 23H2 and 24H2, with corresponding KB articles such as KB5041592 and KB5041585 outlining necessary updates for affected users to mitigate this risk.",
