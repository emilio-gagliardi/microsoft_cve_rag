  "description": "The observed symptom involves a failure of floppy drives attributed to the use of McAfee software. This issue caused users to experience significant disruptions, compelling them to implement a secondary bootable drive on each affected computer. The incident reflects serious operational challenges faced during the problematic period of '96 or '97, marking a turning point in the reliance on McAfee for system control. System administrators should be aware of legacy software's potential impact on hardware functionality, particularly in environments utilizing older technology. This situation serves as a cautionary tale for integrating antivirus software with critical system components, including bootable drives.",
