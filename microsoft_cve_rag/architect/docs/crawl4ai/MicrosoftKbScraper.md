Below is a step‐by‐step explanation of how the MicrosoftKbScraper works, along with suggestions for where you could set breakpoints to inspect intermediate variables and responses:

Initialization (Constructor of BaseScraper and MicrosoftKbScraper):
When a MicrosoftKbScraper instance is created, the constructor of BaseScraper initializes the browser and crawler configurations (BrowserConfig and CrawlerRunConfig).
Breakpoint Suggestion: Set a breakpoint right after self.run_config = ... in BaseScraper.init to verify that the config values (word_count_threshold, css_selector, etc.) are correct.
Process Crawl Result (BaseScraper.process_crawl_result):
The method checks if the crawl result indicates success by examining a success attribute.
It then retrieves the raw HTML from the crawl result (result.html), which will be used later for further processing.
Breakpoint Suggestion: Place a breakpoint after raw_html = getattr(crawl_result, "html", "") to inspect the raw HTML and then just before returning the fallback dictionary. Also, check inside the try/except whether the extraction strategy returned an error.
Preprocessing HTML (MicrosoftKbScraper.preprocess_html):
This method uses BeautifulSoup to parse the raw HTML and remove unwanted elements:
It removes the <div id="supLeftNav"> block.
It also removes any <div> elements with classes such as "ocArticleFooterShareContainer", "ocArticleFooterFeedPickerContainer", "ocArticleFooterSection articleSupportBridge", and "ocFooterWrapper".
Breakpoint Suggestion: Set a breakpoint immediately after creating the BeautifulSoup object (i.e., right after soup = BeautifulSoup(html, "html.parser")) and then after unwanted elements are decomposed. This lets you inspect the modified DOM before it is converted back into a string.
LLM Extraction (MicrosoftKbScraper.extract_with_llm):
This method builds a detailed prompt that specifies the desired KB report schema, including keys like "title", "applies_to", "os_builds", etc.
It then instantiates an LLMExtractionStrategy (using the provider "google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free") and calls its extract() method with the cleaned HTML.
Breakpoint Suggestion:
Set a breakpoint right before calling llm_strategy.extract(html) to verify that the prompt has been constructed correctly and that the API key is loaded.
Optionally, set another breakpoint after the extract() call to inspect the returned structured JSON from the LLM.
Content Extraction (_extract_content):
This method is the integration point where the scraped crawl result is processed. It calls process_crawl_result to get raw HTML, then uses preprocess_html to clean the HTML, and finally passes the cleaned HTML to extract_with_llm to obtain the structured JSON.
Breakpoint Suggestion:
Place a breakpoint after retrieving raw_html from the crawl result.
Set another breakpoint after obtaining cleaned_html from preprocess_html to confirm that unwanted elements are removed.
Set one more breakpoint after the LLM extraction call in order to inspect the final JSON structure.
High-Level Scraping (MicrosoftKbScraper.scrape_kb_article):
This asynchronous method wraps the entire process:
It uses crawler.arun from crawl4ai to fetch the page asynchronously.
It checks that the result has valid cleaned HTML.
It then calls the integrated extraction chain (i.e., _extract_content) and returns the structured content.
Breakpoint Suggestion:
Set a breakpoint immediately after the await crawler.arun(...) call to examine the raw crawl result (result).
After verifying that result.cleaned_html is valid, step into the call to _extract_content to see the flow through the preprocess and LLM extraction steps.
Main Function (main):
In your main() function, you instantiate MicrosoftKbScraper and call scrape_kb_article with a given URL.
Breakpoint Suggestion: Set a breakpoint at the beginning of main() and right after the scraper returns its content. This lets you inspect the final output and verify that everything is integrated correctly.
By placing breakpoints at these key locations, you can step through the process:

Check configuration values during initialization.
Verify raw HTML extraction.
Inspect the sanitized DOM after exclusion filtering.
Confirm that the LLM prompt is correct and that the extraction returns the structured JSON.
Finally, observe the end-to-end flow in the high-level scrape_kb_article method.
This approach provides a clear view of each transformation step and helps diagnose any issues in the scraping and extraction pipeline. Let me know if you need further details or modifications!
